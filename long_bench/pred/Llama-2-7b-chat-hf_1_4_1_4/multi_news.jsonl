The study exposed MRSA to cigarette smoke extract and found that it became harder to kill, with a significant increase in resistance to reactive oxygen species, which are used by macrophages to kill pathogens. The second study, published in the journal Infection and Immunity, found that cigarette smoke exposure can also alter the cell walls of MRSA, making it more resistant to antimicrobial peptides, which are used to pierce bacterial cell walls.

The CDC has identified enterovirus D68 as a possible cause of the illness, although the exact cause remains unknown. The illness typically occurs in children, but adults have also been affected. Symptoms include sudden weakness or paralysis of the arms or legs, and in some cases, patients have reported respiratory or fever symptoms before the onset of neurological symptoms.

{"pred": " In a recent discovery, scientists have found a new species of theropod dinosaur, Caihong juji, which lived 161 million years ago in northeastern China. The fossilized remains of this small, bird-like dinosaur were found to have iridescent feathers on its head, chest, and tail, similar to those of modern hummingbirds. The discovery of Caihong provides new insights into the evolution of feathers and their potential functions in dinosaurs. The holotype specimen of Caihong is preserved with associated plumage, allowing scientists to study the melanosomes (pigment sacs) within the feathers and reconstruct the original colors. The team found that the melanosomes on Caihong's head, chest, and tail were long, flat, and organized into sheets, similar to those of hummingbirds. The discovery of Caihong's iridescent feathers suggests that the evolution of feathers originally evolved for display, rather than flight, and that birds evolved from feathered theropod dinosaurs. The finding also raises the question of how Caihong used its iridescent feathers, or whether males or females of the species had different plumage. Further study of the new fossil and other feathered dinosaurs may provide answers to these questions.", "answers": ["Scientists are now saying there may have been \"a more colorful Jurassic World than we previously imagined,\" thanks to the recent discovery of a fossil in China's Hebei province. Reuters reports that a closer look at the \"exquisitely preserved,\" almost completely intact fossil of a crow-like dinosaur that lived about 161 million years ago revealed that Caihong juji had luminous, brilliantly hued feathers that closely resembled those of hummingbirds. The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree. And \"glide\" is the operative word, as this dinosaur likely didn't fly: Its feathers were located on its tail, not on its wings like birds, Discover notes.

Here's what to expect from a day of drama in DC: The House has passed legislation to delay ObamaCare for a year and repeal a tax on medical devices, so the measure will return to the Senate this afternoon, just hours before the shutdown is due to kick in. Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

The spacecraft will be launched in summer 2018 and will be the first mission to visit the sun, aiming to trace the energy behind the solar wind, understand the heating of the solar corona, and determine what accelerates the solar wind. The spacecraft will be equipped with advanced instruments to study the sun's corona and solar wind, and will make a Venus flyby before reaching its first perihelion, or closest point to the sun, seven times closer than any other spacecraft has been to the sun. The mission will also pass through the origin of the solar particles with the highest energy. The findings will help answer questions about how stars work and improve space weather forecasting. The renaming of the mission is a fitting tribute to Parker, who is considered a pioneer in the field of solar physics.", "answers": ["NASA is going to the sun. More specifically, it's launching an unmanned probe next year that will travel closer to the star than any spacecraft has done previously. \"It's a spacecraft loaded with technological breakthroughs that will solve many of the largest mysteries about our star,\" says Nicola Fox of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. In less scientific terms, per the Telegraph: \"We will finally touch the sun.\" The nuts and bolts: The mission: The 10-foot probe will launch in July or August of 2018 and eventually get to within 3.7 million miles of the sun, about seven times closer than any previous spacecraft. Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025. Corona: The probe will actually fly into the outermost part of the sun's atmosphere, called the corona, per a mission overview at NASA that touts \"humanity's first visit to a star.\" The heat: The probe will rely on a 4.5-inch-thick carbon-composite solar shield to help it withstand temperatures up to 2,550 degrees Fahrenheit, reports Orlando's WKMG. Instruments will remain at room temperature. The name: The probe's name has been changed to the Parker Solar Probe to honor astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who's credited with discovering solar wind. Parker, who turns 90 in June, is a professor emeritus at the University of Chicago, and the Guardian recounts that the theory he put forward in 1958 about a stream of charged particles flowing from the sun was once thought to be \"crazy.\" A first: This is the first time NASA has named a mission after a living scientist. \"I'm certainly greatly honored,\" said the man himself, per Space.com.

{"pred": " A new study has found that rapidly losing and regaining weight, also known as \"yo-yo dieting,\" may increase the risk of deadly heart attacks and strokes for people with coronary artery disease. The study, conducted by researchers at New York University School of Medicine, followed 9,509 men and women with stable coronary artery disease over five years and found that those with the greatest changes in body weight experienced a 124% higher risk of death, 117% more heart attacks, and 136% more strokes compared to those with the smallest body weight changes. The study suggests that keeping weight off is important for people with coronary artery disease, and that weight fluctuations may be particularly harmful for this group. Additionally, the study found a link between changes in body weight and increased risk of new-onset diabetes. The researchers believe that their findings warrant further investigation into how to help Americans keep weight off and reduce their risk of heart disease.", "answers": ["Losing weight is one thing, keeping it off quite another. And now researchers are finding that among those with coronary heart disease (CHD)—which the Mayo Clinic reports develops from damaged or diseased blood vessels typically caused by blockage and inflammation—yo-yo dieting may dramatically increase the risk of stroke, heart attack, and death. Reporting in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers say they followed nearly 10,000 men and women with CHD between the ages of 35 and 75 for about five years, monitoring changes in body weight and other health outcomes. The takeaway? \"It's important to lose weight, but this data says you have to keep it off,\" lead researcher Dr. Sripal Bangalore at the New York University School of Medicine tells the New York Times. The highest weight fluctuation was on average 8.6 pounds over five years, while the smallest body weight changes averaged closer to two pounds, reports Medical News Today. Those who were already overweight or obese at the beginning of the study and who experienced the highest level of weight fluctuation experienced 124% more deaths, 136% more strokes, and 117% more heart attacks, meaning these CHD patients were more than twice as likely to suffer these negative outcomes in just a few years than people with CHD whose weight only fluctuated two pounds. This doesn't pinpoint a cause, as pre-existing heart problems could be the culprit, but researchers hope to study this correlation further.

This trend is expected to continue, with nearly one in four rectal tumors and over one in 10 colon cancers expected to be diagnosed in people under 50 by 2030. Younger patients are more likely to have advanced stage cancer, but they live slightly longer without a cancer recurrence due to more aggressive treatment. The reasons for this increase in colon cancer among younger adults are unknown, but risk factors such as smoking, obesity, physical inactivity, and a poor diet may be contributing. The study suggests that screening for colon cancer may need to begin at an earlier age, but this would be a costly change and more research is needed to understand its effectiveness.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained.

The discovery of these ancient artifacts has the potential to rewrite the story of Indigenous Australians and their technological capabilities.

The infection led to a UTI, which caused her kidneys to become inflamed and damaged. Oakleigh has been hospitalized multiple times for testing and treatment, and doctors have discovered that she has stage 3 kidney reflux. The infection was caused by a dangerous, antibiotic-resistant strain of Pseudomonas, which has made treatment challenging. Oakleigh's family is grateful for her progress and thankful for the support they have received.\n\nPassage 2: What is a Pseudomonas Infection?\nPseudomonas infections are caused by a common type of bacteria called Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These infections can be serious and difficult to treat because the bacteria can resist many types of antibiotics. People in the hospital, especially those with weakened immune systems, are at risk of developing Pseudomonas infections. The bacteria can spread through medical equipment, cleaning solutions, and other hospital environments.\n\nPassage 3: Oklahoma Infant Fights \"Super Strain\" of E. coli\nAn Oklahoma infant, Oakleigh Nance, is fighting for her life after contracting a \"super strain\" of E. coli. Doctors are investigating the case, and the family is hoping she can fight off the disease before an upcoming kidney surgery that could save her life. Oakleigh was born premature and has had several health issues since birth, including a kidney issue.

This procedure is known as microtia, which affects about 1 in 100,000 babies. Kieran was born deaf and had small lobes where his ears should have been. He can already hear thanks to previous surgery to implant a hearing aid, but he wanted to look like his friends and wear sunglasses and earphones. The surgery, led by consultant plastic surgeon Neil Bulstrode, involved harvesting cartilage from Kieran's ribs, shaping it into frameworks for his ears, and then grafting them onto his head under pockets of skin. The operation brings significant improvements in quality of life for children with microtia, and researchers are working on growing new ear frameworks from a child's own stem cells using tissue engineering. This approach would be far less invasive than the current method of harvesting a child's rib cartilage. Kieran is delighted with his new ears and will have a follow-up operation in six months to make them stand out more.", "answers": ["An operation in London has given 9-year-old Kieran Sorkin a pair of ears—made from his ribs, no less.

The ears should last, too, because they're made of cartilage rather than prosthetics, the Guardian reports. Every year about 100 British newborns lack one or both ears (it's called microtia), and the hospital Kieran went to performs the operation about 40 times a year. Scientists hope to one day make ears from the fat tissue of patients, instead of ribs. Kieran might have liked that, since he got so excited on seeing his new ears that he cried \"Wow!\" and giggled—which made his ribs hurt from the operation.

The operation came after a series of tit-for-tat skirmishes between Israel and Palestinian militants, and followed a rocket attack on Tel Aviv that killed three people. Israel mobilized up to 75,000 reservists and launched airstrikes on Hamas targets, while Hamas fired rockets at Israeli cities. Egypt's President Mohamed Morsi visited Gaza to explore a possibility of reaching a truce, but the efforts were met with skepticism by both sides. The conflict has stoked fears of a wider Middle East conflict, with Egypt and Israel receiving billions of dollars in U.S. military aid to underwrite their treaty. The United States has asked countries that have contact with Hamas to urge the Islamist movement to stop its rocket attacks, while Hamas refuses to recognize Israel's right to exist. The conflict has resulted in the deaths of at least 19 Palestinians and 3 Israelis, with hundreds more wounded on both sides.", "answers": ["A brief, planned ceasefire failed to materialize in Gaza today, as death continued to rain down on the strip. Israel had offered to hold its offensive to accommodate a visit from Egyptian Prime Minister Hesham Kandil, provided Hamas held its fire as well. But Hamas said it would keep firing, and one Israeli defense minister complained that 50 rockets had flown in from Gaza during Kandil's visit, CNN reports. A Hamas-run TV station reported that Israel had kept firing as well, but Israel says it took a break for at least two hours. In Palestine the death toll has risen to 21, including 13 civilians, Reuters reports. Among those civilians were seven children and a pregnant teenager. Israel's death toll held steady at 3, despite the hundreds of rockets fired into Israel. But Hamas did up the ante by firing rockets near Tel Aviv for the first time. Air-raid sirens sounded (the last time they did so was during the Gulf War) and civilians ran for cover, though the missiles exploded harmlessly, with one going into the sea. \"There will be a price for that escalation,\" Ehud Barak vowed, according to the New York Times. Israel has now hit 250 Gaza targets, while taking further steps toward a ground invasion, calling up 16,000 reservists, the Wall Street Journal reports. It's also steadily sending troops and armored vehicles to the border, notes CNN—between 1,500 and 2,000 are already there, one official said. Israel claims the attacks have weakened Hamas' military capabilities and caused its attacks to lighten, but Hamas denied that, saying it had hit multiple Israeli targets today. Kandil emerged from his meeting with Hamas expressing solidarity, saying the new Egyptian regime would be more active in helping the Palestinians. \"The time has changed,\" he said. \"No longer the Israeli occupation will be able to carry out their attacks against the Palestinians without being held responsible. That time is far bygone.\" For its part, the Obama administration says it's seeking help from Arab countries in calling on Hamas to relent. \"The onus rests squarely on Hamas ... to stop its rocket attacks,\" says a State Department spokesman.

{"pred": " A recent study by NASA scientists has revealed that Mars once had a massive ocean that covered nearly half of the planet's surface, with evidence suggesting that the ocean was up to 137 meters deep. The study used atmospheric maps to determine that water in the polar reservoirs is enriched in deuterium, indicating that Mars had a global equivalent water layer at least 8 times deeper than Earth's ocean. This finding supports the idea that Mars was once habitable and may have had life. Additionally, the study found that the Martian atmosphere has been thinning over time, leading to the loss of water to space. The search for life on Mars will continue in 2018 with the European Space Agency's Exomars rover, which will look for chemical signatures of life in the Martian soil. The study also highlights the possibility that life could have originated on Mars and been ejected to Earth as a meteorite. Another recent study analyzed the water vapor in the Martian atmosphere and found that the planet's thin atmosphere can be seen in a photo taken by the Viking 1 orbiter. The team of scientists led by Geronimo Villanueva, of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, took measurements of sunlight reflecting off the Martian surface and through the atmosphere, which revealed the chemical composition of the atmosphere's vapor. The study found that Mars had a higher proportion of deuterium in its water than Earth, indicating that Mars had a much greater amount of water in the past. The study also suggests that the early Martian atmosphere was unusually rich in heavy hydrogen and that much of it escaped along with the ordinary variety, which could have skewed any calculations based on today's values. Overall, the findings continue to mount that Mars was once far wetter and potentially habitable, with the possibility of life existing on the planet in the past.", "answers": ["Imagine all the water in the Arctic Ocean. Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

Bayesian statisticians can update their estimates of the probability of finding the plane at any given location based on new information.

They split the search area into a grid and applied probabilities to each cell, taking into account the uncertainties of each piece of data. The team also lowered the probability of the plane being found in locations that had already been searched. The Bayesian approach allows for the consideration of all data, including uncertainties, and the combination of views that contradict each other.

The Metron team outlined its success in a paper that makes plain the subjectivity inherent in the approach.

Named after Presbyterian minister and mathematician Thomas Bayes, the technique allowed experts to apply several factors to each point on a map: For example, what was the chance it crashed from mechanical failure? How far do planes tend to crash from their last known location? What was the chance that search teams missed debris in various locations?

The report, published in the Lancet medical journal, found that obesity rates have risen significantly in both developed and developing countries over the past 30 years, with the highest rates found in the Middle East and North Africa, Central America, and the Pacific and Caribbean islands. The report also found that obesity is now a major risk factor for heart disease, stroke, diabetes, arthritis, and certain cancers, and that chronic complications of weight kill about 3.4 million adults annually. The researchers noted that obesity is a complex problem fueled by the availability of cheap, fatty, sugary, salty, high-calorie \"junk food\" and the rise of sedentary lifestyles, and that not one country has succeeded in cutting its obesity rate. The report highlighted that the number of overweight and obese people rose from 857 million in 1980 to 2.1 billion in 2013, exceeding the total world population of 1927.
