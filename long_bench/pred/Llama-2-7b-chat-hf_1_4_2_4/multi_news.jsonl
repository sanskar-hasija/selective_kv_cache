The first study, conducted by researchers at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine, found that cigarette smoke exposure stresses MRSA, causing it to alter its cell walls and become more resistant to toxic substances. This enhances its survival against reactive oxygen species, which macrophages generate to kill pathogens. The study found that MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke extract were four times more resistant to macrophage killing than non-exposed MRSA. The second study, led by Dr. Laura Crotty Alexander, found that cigarette smoke exposure makes MRSA more aggressive and better at invading human cells. The study also found that the increased resistance continued for 24 hours after exposure, suggesting it could be inherited. The studies suggest that cigarette smoke functions much like an alarm to MRSA, warning it to activate its defenses and become more resistant to toxic substances. These findings add to the growing body of evidence that cigarette smoke is not only harmful to smokers themselves, but also to the microorganisms that cause infectious diseases.", "answers": ["Superbugs such as MRSA are already bad enough.

The New York Times reports that VX agent can be created by mixing two compounds—and police suspect the two women put the substances on Kim's face, one after the other, to create a deadly dose.

The memo alleges that the FBI abused its surveillance authority when it sought a secret court order to monitor a former Trump campaign adviser.

{"pred": " In a recent discovery, scientists have found a new species of theropod dinosaur in northeastern China, which has iridescent feathers that may have glittered with the colors of the rainbow. The dinosaur, named Caihong juji, means \"rainbow with a big crest\" in Mandarin, and its well-preserved remains have revealed traces of pigment sacs called melanosomes in its feathers. This discovery suggests that feathers originally evolved for display, and may have been used for social or sexual cues, like modern peacock tails. Caihong had a bird-like body, including the necessary feathers for flight, but it also had a crested head that more closely resembles that of a Velociraptor. The team also found that Caihong's tail had asymmetrical feathers, which may have been used for aerodynamic locomotion. This discovery provides new insights into the evolution of birds and their feathers, and may shed light on the functions of Caihong's iridescent feathers.", "answers": ["Scientists are now saying there may have been \"a more colorful Jurassic World than we previously imagined,\" thanks to the recent discovery of a fossil in China's Hebei province. Reuters reports that a closer look at the \"exquisitely preserved,\" almost completely intact fossil of a crow-like dinosaur that lived about 161 million years ago revealed that Caihong juji had luminous, brilliantly hued feathers that closely resembled those of hummingbirds. The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree. And \"glide\" is the operative word, as this dinosaur likely didn't fly: Its feathers were located on its tail, not on its wings like birds, Discover notes.

The tax has also led to a decline in sales for retailers, with some customers crossing city limits to buy products cheaper. In Cook County, Illinois, a similar tax was repealed after a short time due to its unpopularity. The repeal was seen as a victory for the beverage industry, which spent millions fighting the tax. In Spokane, there are concerns that a similar tax could be passed statewide, leading to increased costs for businesses and consumers.

The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line.

The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits.

The second story provides details on the potential impact of a government shutdown on the Washington D.C. area, including the potential furlough of 60% of the area's 377,000 federal workers, the delay of new patient enrollments in clinical trials at the National Institutes of Health, and the potential loss of income tax revenue for local governments. The passage also includes quotes from various politicians and economists on the potential impact of a shutdown.", "answers": ["Washington is braced for the first government shutdown in 17 years, which will happen at midnight tonight unless lawmakers manage to break the deadlock over funding and hammer out a deal. Here's what to expect from a day of drama in DC: The House has passed legislation to delay ObamaCare for a year and repeal a tax on medical devices, so the measure will return to the Senate this afternoon, just hours before the shutdown is due to kick in. Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

The spacecraft will be launched in summer 2018 and will be the first mission to visit the sun, aiming to trace the energy behind the solar wind, understand the heating of the solar corona, and determine what accelerates the solar wind. The spacecraft will be equipped with advanced instruments to study the sun's magnetic field, plasma, and energetic particles. The mission will also pass through the origin of the solar particles with the highest energy. The Parker Solar Probe will be the closest spacecraft to the sun, reaching an orbit within 3.7 million miles of the sun's surface, and will provide valuable insights into the physics of stars and space weather.", "answers": ["NASA is going to the sun. More specifically, it's launching an unmanned probe next year that will travel closer to the star than any spacecraft has done previously. \"It's a spacecraft loaded with technological breakthroughs that will solve many of the largest mysteries about our star,\" says Nicola Fox of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. In less scientific terms, per the Telegraph: \"We will finally touch the sun.\" The nuts and bolts: The mission: The 10-foot probe will launch in July or August of 2018 and eventually get to within 3.7 million miles of the sun, about seven times closer than any previous spacecraft. Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025. Corona: The probe will actually fly into the outermost part of the sun's atmosphere, called the corona, per a mission overview at NASA that touts \"humanity's first visit to a star.\" The heat: The probe will rely on a 4.5-inch-thick carbon-composite solar shield to help it withstand temperatures up to 2,550 degrees Fahrenheit, reports Orlando's WKMG. Instruments will remain at room temperature. The name: The probe's name has been changed to the Parker Solar Probe to honor astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who's credited with discovering solar wind. Parker, who turns 90 in June, is a professor emeritus at the University of Chicago, and the Guardian recounts that the theory he put forward in 1958 about a stream of charged particles flowing from the sun was once thought to be \"crazy.\" A first: This is the first time NASA has named a mission after a living scientist. \"I'm certainly greatly honored,\" said the man himself, per Space.com.

The highest weight fluctuation was on average 8.6 pounds over five years, while the smallest body weight changes averaged closer to two pounds, reports Medical News Today. Those who were already overweight or obese at the beginning of the study and who experienced the highest level of weight fluctuation experienced 124% more deaths, 136% more strokes, and 117% more heart attacks, meaning these CHD patients were more than twice as likely to suffer these negative outcomes in just a few years than people with CHD whose weight only fluctuated two pounds. This doesn't pinpoint a cause, as pre-existing heart problems could be the culprit, but researchers hope to study this correlation further.

When officers arrived at her apartment, she refused to answer the door, and a locksmith was used to enter the apartment, where Markham was interviewed. She told officers she wanted to get a second opinion about her child's treatment. The baby was taken to the hospital, but Markham did not show up, and she was arrested on a charge of child neglect. The baby was placed in state custody, and Markham later bonded out of jail. In a surprising turn of events, a Seminole County judge granted Markham custody of her son, Caleb, with the provision that she provide a nutritionist's report within 10 days. The judge threw out Seminole County Child Protective Services' claim that Markham was not fit to care for the child, and the criminal case against her is expected to be thrown out as well.

One in seven colorectal cancer patients are now diagnosed before the age of 50. Younger patients are more likely to have advanced stage cancer, but they live slightly longer without a cancer recurrence due to more aggressive treatment. The study suggests that the medical community needs to be more aware of the signs of colorectal cancer in younger patients, as they are often diagnosed only after symptoms appear. The reasons for the increase in colon cancer among younger adults are unknown, but risk factors such as smoking, obesity, physical inactivity, and a poor diet may be contributing. The study also found that younger patients lived a little longer without a cancer recurrence, even though they tended to have more advanced cancer. These findings raise the question of whether screening for colon cancer should begin at an earlier age.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says.

This discovery fits with genetic evidence that Homo sapiens originated in Africa between 350,000 and 260,000 years ago. The new reports also suggest that early Homo sapiens and their immediate African ancestors were at least as smart as the scientists investigating them, and that they made some pretty innovative tools.\n\nIn addition, three new papers published in Science reveal that technologically advanced behaviors occurred much earlier than previously thought in the African stone age. The papers highlight technological change at around 300,000 years ago that likely occurred in response to the effects of long-term, global environmental and climatic change. This suggests that hominin populations did not disappear but rather adapted technologically and culturally, with the environment driving greater mobility, information gathering, and innovation.\n\nThe discoveries provide evidence of the evolution of modern human behaviors much earlier than previously thought, with the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the East African record.

Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago.

This comes after Trump's Homeland Security Adviser, Tom Bossert, defended the president's tweet showing him body-slamming and punching a person signifying CNN, saying that no one would perceive it as a threat. However, Bossert's defense was met with criticism from CNN contributor Ana Navarro, who said that the tweet was an incitement to violence.\n\nSecondly, President Trump has been accused of using social media in a \"modern day presidential\" manner, as he asserted in a tweet. However, this claim has been met with skepticism, with some Republicans expressing concerns about the president's Twitter habit. Nebraska Sen.

Air-raid sirens sounded (the last time they did so was during the Gulf War) and civilians ran for cover, though the missiles exploded harmlessly, with one going into the sea. \"There will be a price for that escalation,\" Ehud Barak vowed, according to the New York Times. Israel has now hit 250 Gaza targets, while taking further steps toward a ground invasion, calling up 16,000 reservists, the Wall Street Journal reports. It's also steadily sending troops and armored vehicles to the border, notes CNN—between 1,500 and 2,000 are already there, one official said. Israel claims the attacks have weakened Hamas' military capabilities and caused its attacks to lighten, but Hamas denied that, saying it had hit multiple Israeli targets today. Kandil emerged from his meeting with Hamas expressing solidarity, saying the new Egyptian regime would be more active in helping the Palestinians. \"The time has changed,\" he said. \"No longer the Israeli occupation will be able to carry out their attacks against the Palestinians without being held responsible. That time is far bygone.\" For its part, the Obama administration says it's seeking help from Arab countries in calling on Hamas to relent. \"The onus rests squarely on Hamas ... to stop its rocket attacks,\" says a State Department spokesman.

{"pred": " A recent study by NASA scientists has revealed that Mars once had a massive ocean that covered nearly half of the planet's surface, with evidence suggesting that the ocean was up to 137 meters deep. The study used atmospheric maps to determine that water in the polar reservoirs is enriched in deuterium, indicating that Mars had a global equivalent water layer at least 20 million cubic kilometers in size. This finding supports the idea that Mars was once habitable and could have supported life. Additionally, the study found that the ocean on Mars was likely to have been a warm and wet planet, with the infrared maps showing that water near the Martian ice caps is enriched with deuterium. The higher concentration of deuterium means that Mars must have lost a vast amount of water in the past, equivalent to more than six times that locked up in the planet's frozen ice caps. The study also suggests that the ocean on Mars was probably much deeper than previously thought, with the possibility of it covering the entire surface of the planet. These findings further support the notion that life might have existed on Mars in the past.", "answers": ["Imagine all the water in the Arctic Ocean. Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

{"pred": " According to a new report by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington-Seattle, obesity is a growing problem worldwide, with nearly 30% of the global population, or 2.1 billion people, being either obese or overweight. The report found that obesity rates are rising in both developed and developing countries, with some countries experiencing extraordinary levels of obesity, such as Tonga and Kiribati among men, and Samoa and Tonga among women. The report also noted that population-wide weight gains and income gains generally go hand in hand around the world, which may support a theory that a major cause of obesity is that food has become cheap relative to income. The World Health Organization has launched a commission to study rising obesity among children worldwide and suggest solutions, with a report due in early 2015.\n\nThe report also found that the richest country, the United States, has the biggest chunk of the planet's obese population, with 13% of its population being obese, despite claiming less than 5% of the total population. The researchers said that obesity is now a main risk factor for morbidity and mortality, and that it is appearing at increasing young ages, rising nearly 50% in children and adolescents worldwide. The report noted that more than half of the world's obese live in just 10 countries, including the United States, China, India, Russia, Brazil, Mexico, Egypt, Germany, Pakistan, and Indonesia.\n\nIn conclusion, the report highlights the urgent need for action to address the growing obesity epidemic worldwide, particularly in developing countries where the problem is accelerating. The report also suggests that the availability of cheap, fatty, sugary, salty, high-calorie \"junk food\" and the rise of sedentary lifestyles are major factors contributing to the problem.", "answers": ["There are more obese or overweight people in the world today than there were people of any weight in 1935, the most comprehensive look at worldwide obesity in decades warns.

Mubarak's two sons, Gamal and Alaa, are also facing corruption charges in the same case.
