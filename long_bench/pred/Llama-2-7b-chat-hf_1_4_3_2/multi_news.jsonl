According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 32 new cases of AFM have been confirmed across the country since August, more than double the number of cases reported last year. The CDC is working to determine the cause of the increase in AFM cases, but so far, no cause has been identified. The illness typically affects children, and the symptoms include weakness or paralysis of the arms or legs, as well as difficulty with speech, swallowing, and breathing. The CDC is urging healthcare providers to report any cases of AFM to help identify the cause of the increase in cases.\n\nIt is important to note that while the number of AFM cases has increased, the overall incidence of the disease remains rare, with only a few cases reported each year in the United States. However, the sudden increase in cases has caused concern among health officials and parents, and efforts are being made to determine the cause and prevent further cases.\n\nIn related news, a new study has found that enterovirus D68, which was previously linked to a large outbreak of respiratory illness in 2014, may also be a possible cause of AFM. The study found that 75% of children with AFM had evidence of enterovirus in their spinal fluid, compared to only 10% of children without AFM. While the study did not prove that enterovirus D68 causes AFM, it suggests that it may be a contributing factor.\n\nOverall, the recent increase in AFM cases has highlighted the importance of ongoing research into this rare and mysterious illness, and the need for continued vigilance in monitoring and reporting cases to help identify the cause and prevent further illness.", "answers": ["At first, it seemed like 4-year-old Laura Carson was suffering from a simple headache.

{"pred": " The Shroud of Turin, a linen cloth long revered as the burial cloth of Jesus, has been the subject of intense scrutiny and debate for centuries. Recently, a new forensic investigation has cast doubt on the shroud's authenticity, suggesting that it may be a medieval fraud.\n\nThe investigation, published in the Journal of Forensic Sciences, analyzed the bloodstain patterns on the cloth using seven different tests on different body parts depicted on the fabric. The researchers found that the bloodstains are inconsistent with any one pose, suggesting that a standing model was used to imprint the patterns at different angles. This contradicts the idea that the shroud is a death shroud of a bleeding, executed person, hung on a cross or pulled down for burial.\n\nThe investigation also found that the bloodstains on the shroud do not match the angles at which gravity would pull the blood, which is not what would be expected if the body was in a crucified position. The forearm rivulets on the shroud matched an arm held straight out at 90 degrees, while the hand marks matched an arm held out at 45 degrees. However, the hand bloodstains traced angles at odds with each other, off by as much as 10 degrees.\n\nThe investigation concluded that the Shroud of Turin is inconsistent with any real crucifixion wounds and is likely a medieval fraud. This conclusion is supported by the inconsistent bloodstain patterns and the fact that the bloodstains do not match the angles at which gravity would pull the blood.\n\nIt is important to note that the Vatican regards the Shroud of Turin as an icon, rather than a religious relic, and the church has never weighed in on its authenticity or officially rejected it. However, this latest forensic investigation adds to the growing body of evidence suggesting that the shroud may not be the burial cloth of Jesus after all.", "answers": ["The Shroud of Turin is supposedly the burial cloth that was wrapped around Jesus after his crucifixion; bloodstains on the linen shroud, which are said to have been transferred to it during the three days Jesus was in the tomb, form the image of a crucified man.

Researchers looking at the blood spatter found that the stains appeared to come from someone standing up, rather than someone who was flat on the fabric, Science Alert reports. As the researchers put it, the stains are \"totally unrealistic\" when compared to what they should look like. The shroud, which is held in the Cathedral of St. John the Baptist in Italy, is considered an icon, as opposed to a genuine religious relic, by the Vatican; Fox News notes \"the church has never weighed in on its authenticity.\" \"This is the kind of forensic work done all the time in police investigations,\" the forensic scientist who conducted the analysis tells BuzzFeed News. \"Even a crucified or hanging person should leave a distinct blood pattern on the cloth, which would be fascinating information to have.\" The study found inconsistent staining, with researchers concluding multiple poses were used to create the bloodstains—a standing model was likely used to imprint patterns on the cloth at various angles for various body parts. Another bloodstain pattern expert notes that more research could be done to see whether cleaning a body or preparing it for burial might account for the inconsistent staining, though he notes that the stains do appear to have come from flowing blood, meaning a heart that was beating at the time the stains were made.

The lawsuit comes on the heels of a previous lawsuit filed by another man, Michael Egan, who alleges he was drugged and sexually assaulted by Singer and other defendants at parties in the late 1990s.\n\nAccording to the new lawsuit, Singer and Goddard allegedly drugged the 14-year-old boy and sexually assaulted him at a hotel suite in London. The lawsuit also names Goddard, a producer of theme park rides, as the alleged perpetrator of a separate sexual assault.\n\nHerman, the lawyer representing the new plaintiff, has been involved in several high-profile cases involving sexual abuse, including representing clients who have accused the Catholic Church and the Boy Scouts of sexual abuse. He has also represented clients who have accused Hollywood elites of sexual assault, including Egan's lawsuit against Singer.\n\nThe defendants have denied the allegations, with Singer's lawyer calling the lawsuit a \"shakedown\" and suggesting that the new plaintiff is trying to profit from the \"spurious\" and \"false\" claims of Egan's lawsuit.\n\nThe lawsuit is part of a growing trend of people coming forward with allegations of sexual abuse against powerful individuals in positions of power, including Hollywood executives, politicians, and religious leaders. The #MeToo movement has helped to create a cultural shift in which victims of sexual abuse are feeling more emboldened to come forward and share their stories.\n\nIn conclusion, the lawsuit against Bryan Singer and Gary Goddard is the latest example of the growing awareness of sexual abuse in Hollywood and beyond.

{"pred": " In a recent discovery, scientists have found a new species of theropod dinosaur, Caihong juji, in northeastern China. This dinosaur had iridescent feathers on its head, chest, and parts of its tail, similar to those of modern hummingbirds. The feathers were found to have long, flat structures that were arranged in a sheet-like pattern, similar to the iridescent throat feathers of hummingbirds. The discovery of these iridescent feathers suggests that feathers originally evolved for display, rather than flight, and that birds may have used these colorful displays to attract mates or signal to other birds. The discovery of Caihong juji also provides evidence that some dinosaurs may have had the ability to glide through the air, as the dinosaur's forelimbs were found to be proportionally short and its tail was found to have asymmetrical feathers, which could have borne the aerodynamic load of flight. Additionally, the discovery of Caihong juji's crest, which resembles that of a Velociraptor, suggests that some dinosaurs may have had a similar appearance to modern birds. Overall, the discovery of Caihong juji provides new insights into the evolution of feathers and the diversity of dinosaurs.", "answers": ["Scientists are now saying there may have been \"a more colorful Jurassic World than we previously imagined,\" thanks to the recent discovery of a fossil in China's Hebei province. Reuters reports that a closer look at the \"exquisitely preserved,\" almost completely intact fossil of a crow-like dinosaur that lived about 161 million years ago revealed that Caihong juji had luminous, brilliantly hued feathers that closely resembled those of hummingbirds. The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree. And \"glide\" is the operative word, as this dinosaur likely didn't fly: Its feathers were located on its tail, not on its wings like birds, Discover notes.

The study, which analyzed data from over 64,000 children in Denmark, found that prenatal exposure to acetaminophen may increase the risk of a child being diagnosed with ADHD or hyperkinetic disorder (HKD).

The study's authors emphasize that the data does not imply that acetaminophen causes ADHD, but rather that there may be an interaction between the drug and fetal brain development. The study's findings are consistent with previous research suggesting that hormonal changes during pregnancy can affect fetal brain development, and highlight the importance of carefully weighing the potential risks and benefits of medication use during pregnancy. As a result of these findings, some experts recommend that pregnant women limit their use of acetaminophen and consider alternative pain management strategies, such as massages, baths, or acupuncture.", "answers": ["The bad news about acetaminophen just keeps on coming: A new study finds that use of the drug during pregnancy is linked to \"ADHD-like behavioral problems\" in children, CNN reports.

Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown.

The spacecraft will be launched in summer 2018 and will be the first mission to directly observe the sun's corona, the outer atmosphere of the sun. The spacecraft will be equipped with instruments to study the sun's magnetic field, temperature, and energy, and will make a series of Venus flybys to gain speed and reach the sun. The mission will also study the solar wind, a stream of charged particles emitted by the sun, and will be the closest spacecraft to the sun, reaching within 4 million miles of the sun's surface.\n\nThe spacecraft will be protected from the sun's heat by a carbon-composite solar shield, which is 4.5 inches thick. The spacecraft will also use a thermal protection system and a solar array cooling system to protect it from the sun. The mission will aim to answer questions about how stars work and improve space weather forecasting.\n\nThe Parker Solar Probe will be launched in summer 2018, and the mission will repeat a series of Venus flybys to reach the sun.

Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025.

The discovery was made by two researchers at Caltech, who used a combination of mathematical modeling and computer simulations to identify the planet. The discovery of Planet Nine has sparked debate among astronomers about the definition of a planet and whether Pluto should be considered a planet again. Some argue that Pluto is still a planet, while others believe that it should be classified as a dwarf planet. The discovery of Planet Nine has also reignited the debate over Pluto's status in the solar system.\n\nIn related news, the New Horizons spacecraft has renewed calls for Pluto to be reinstated as a planet. The mission's scientists argue that Pluto should be considered a planet because it is a large, rocky body that orbits the sun, similar to the other planets in the solar system. However, others argue that Pluto's small size and unique orbit make it different from the other planets and that it should be classified as a dwarf planet.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine has also raised questions about the definition of a planet and how planets are classified.

This comes after North Korea recently conducted its sixth nuclear weapon test, which was the most powerful ever detonated by the rogue nation. The test was confirmed by seismological data, and North Korean state media claimed it detonated a hydrogen bomb, which could be fitted atop a long-range missile capable of striking the United States. Weapons experts say it's almost impossible to verify if the warhead and missile could be successfully paired unless North Korea were to actually fire a nuclear-tipped ICBM. In response to the nuclear test, South Korea conducted live-fire drills off the east coast of the Korean Peninsula. The South Korean Navy announced that it would immediately destroy and bury any North Korean ship that provokes, whether it is on or under water. Diplomats in New York gathered at the United Nations and condemned the nuclear test, with the United States planning to circulate a resolution to impose sanctions on Pyongyang. The South Korean President and US President, Donald Trump, spoke by phone and agreed to lift restrictions on the payload weight of South Korea's ballistic missiles, but signs of a rift between the two leaders have become apparent.

{"pred": " The latest research suggests that colorectal cancer is increasingly being diagnosed in younger people, with one in seven patients under the age of 50 being diagnosed with the disease. This trend is particularly concerning as younger patients are more likely to have advanced cancer and to die from the disease. The study found that 37,847 of the 258,000 patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer between 1998 and 2011 were under the age of 50. This represents about 15% of all colorectal cancer patients. Younger patients were more likely to have tumors that had spread to the lymph nodes and other organs, and they were also more likely to undergo aggressive treatment, including surgery and radiation therapy. Despite their more advanced disease, younger patients lived slightly longer without a cancer recurrence. The study suggests that the current guidelines for colorectal cancer screening may need to be reevaluated, as the incidence of colon cancer among younger people is rising. Doctors should be on the lookout for symptoms of colon cancer, including bleeding with bowel movements, changes in bowel habits, and abdominal pain. The reasons for the increase in colon cancer among younger people is unknown, but it may be due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Further research is needed to understand this trend and to determine whether the current guidelines for colorectal cancer screening should be changed.", "answers": ["A new study says one in seven US colon cancer patients is younger than 50—raising questions about why more young people seem to be getting the disease and what can be done about it, reports HealthDay via the Philadelphia Inquirer. \"Colon cancer has traditionally been thought of as a disease of the elderly,\" says lead author Samantha Hendren. \"This study is really a wake-up call to the medical community that a relatively large number of colon cancers are occurring in people under 50.\" Using government data on almost 260,000 colon-cancer patients from 1998 to 2011, the study also says younger patients more often have advanced cancer and undergo surgery (72% compared to 63% of patients over 50). The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says. More screenings for young people might help, but the yield would be low because under-50s are still less likely to get colon cancer. \"This would be a big and costly change,\" says Hendren, who recommends \"a lot of research\" be done first.

At the time, Hamm thought the newly discovered human settlement, a site called Warratyi, was only 5,000 years old.

The study suggests that any advanced civilization determined to maximize its energy use will expand throughout the universe and capture stars from other galaxies.\n\nThe paper also references a new way to detect alien civilizations through their waste heat, which could be detected as infrared radiation. Additionally, the article mentions that advanced civilizations would likely re-engineer their solar systems to capture more energy, potentially dismantling planets to form a shell of satellites around their star.\n\nIn related news, the Internet Archive has created a collection of outsider-uploaded WARCs, known as WARCZone, for reference and clarity for the Wayback Machine.

Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts. Others were made of obsidian from as far as 30 miles away, per the Conversation. (These stone tools are also making waves.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 3668}

The U.S. Justice Department did not comment on the case, but a court motion filed in June asserted that Gibson's Madagascar ebony was contraband. Independent investigations by the Environmental Investigation Agency found that Gibson knowingly imported tainted wood, despite knowing that there was a ban on exports of ebony and rosewood. Gibson denied these allegations, maintaining that all of its purchases from Madagascar had complied with U.S. and Malagasy law.

{"pred": " In a recent breakthrough, scientists have made a groundbreaking discovery about Mars' past. Using advanced technology, they have measured the atmospheric water and deuterium levels across the Martian globe, revealing significant isotopic anomalies and a high deuterium enrichment. This suggests that Mars once had a global ocean that covered nearly a fifth of its surface, with a depth of around 137 meters. The study provides evidence that Mars was a warm and wet planet in its early years, with a global ocean that lasted for millions of years. The findings also suggest that Mars may have had the potential to support life.\n\nAdditionally, a new analysis of Martian water vapor has revealed that the planet's original proportion of ordinary hydrogen and deuterium in its water was identical to Earth's. However, on Mars, the ordinary hydrogen has been gradually leaking into space, resulting in a higher proportion of deuterium in the Martian atmosphere. This study provides a new estimate of the amount of water that Mars had in the past, suggesting that it would have been enough to cover the entire planet to a depth of around 450 feet.\n\nThese findings are significant as they suggest that Mars may have had the conditions necessary to support life in the past.

Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

This decision has implications for brands operating across the EU single market, as it highlights the varying histories in national markets and the importance of providing evidence to prove the distinctiveness of a brand's shape. The case has also been mirrored in the British courts, where Nestlé objected to a trademark for the purple color used by Cadbury to wrap its Dairy Milk chocolate bars.
