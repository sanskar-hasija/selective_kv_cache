{"pred": " Two recent studies have shed light on the harmful effects of cigarette smoke on the human body, particularly when it comes to the superbug MRSA. According to a study published in the journal Infection and Immunity, exposure to cigarette smoke can make MRSA (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) more resistant to antibiotic treatment. The study found that cigarette smoke exposure stresses MRSA, causing it to alter its cell walls to repel toxic substances, making it harder to kill. This enhances survival against reactive oxygen species, which macrophages generate to kill pathogens. The study also found that cigarette smoke exposure makes MRSA more resistant to macrophage killing and antimicrobial peptides.\n\nAnother study, published in the journal Infection and Immunity, found that cigarette smoke functions much like an alarm to MRSA, warning it to activate its defenses. In lab studies in human cells and whole mice, MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke extract became harder to kill. The study also found that the increased resistance continued for 24 hours after exposure, suggesting it could be inherited.\n\nThese findings suggest that cigarette smoke may play a role in the growing problem of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, making it more difficult to treat infections. The studies also highlight the importance of avoiding smoking, not only for the harm it causes to the smoker but also for its impact on the body's ability to fight off infections.", "answers": ["Superbugs such as MRSA are already bad enough.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 32 new cases of AFM have been confirmed across the country this year, with most cases occurring in children. The CDC is investigating the cause of the illness, but it is believed to be linked to enterovirus D68, which was responsible for a similar outbreak in 2014. Doctors are urging parents to be aware of the symptoms of AFM, which include sudden weakness or paralysis of the arms or legs, and to seek medical attention immediately if they suspect their child may have the illness. The CDC is working to identify the cause of the outbreak and to develop effective treatments.\n\nIn related news, a study published in the journal \"Nature Medicine\" has found that the Zika virus may be linked to a rare brain disorder called microcephaly, which causes babies to be born with abnormally small heads and brains. The study suggests that the Zika virus may cause the brain to produce too much of a protein called Shh, which can lead to the development of microcephaly. The researchers involved in the study are calling for further investigation into the possible link between the Zika virus and microcephaly.\n\nAdditionally, a new study published in the journal \"Science\" has found that the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine may be linked to a reduced risk of developing autism. The study analyzed data from over 650,000 children in Denmark and found that those who received the MMR vaccine were less likely to develop autism than those who did not receive the vaccine.

Kerry is the most senior US official to go to Pakistan since bin Laden's death, but since issuing the joint pledge, he said Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will soon announce her own plans to visit, the AP reports. Kerry's meetings with Pakistani leaders began last night, the Washington Post reports. Many in Washington think Pakistan is harboring Islamist militants, and some members of Congress are calling for the US to sever the billions of dollars in aid it provides to Pakistan. Kerry is in Pakistan to lay out the new stakes following bin Laden's death, and question officials about how bin Laden was able to hide in Pakistan for years. In Kabul, Kerry said there is \"some evidence\" that the Pakistan government has knowledge of insurgent activities, calling it \"very disturbing.\""], "all_classes": null, "length": 1688}

{"pred": " In a recent discovery, scientists have found a new species of theropod dinosaur, Caihong juji, which lived in northeastern China around 161 million years ago. This dinosaur had iridescent feathers on its head, neck, and chest, similar to those of modern hummingbirds. The feathers were likely used for display and social interaction, as seen in modern birds. The discovery of Caihong provides new insights into the evolution of feathers and their role in dinosaur behavior. Additionally, the fossilized remains of Caihong were found to have traces of pigment in its feathers, suggesting that the dinosaur may have had a rainbow-like appearance. The discovery of Caihong is significant as it is the oldest known animal to have asymmetrical feathers, which are a key adaptation for flight. The find also raises questions about the functions of the dinosaur's iridescent feathers and how they were used for display and social interaction.", "answers": ["Scientists are now saying there may have been \"a more colorful Jurassic World than we previously imagined,\" thanks to the recent discovery of a fossil in China's Hebei province. Reuters reports that a closer look at the \"exquisitely preserved,\" almost completely intact fossil of a crow-like dinosaur that lived about 161 million years ago revealed that Caihong juji had luminous, brilliantly hued feathers that closely resembled those of hummingbirds. The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree. And \"glide\" is the operative word, as this dinosaur likely didn't fly: Its feathers were located on its tail, not on its wings like birds, Discover notes.

Here's what to expect from a day of drama in DC: The House has passed legislation to delay ObamaCare for a year and repeal a tax on medical devices, so the measure will return to the Senate this afternoon, just hours before the shutdown is due to kick in. Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

The spacecraft will be launched in summer 2018 and will be the first mission to visit the sun, aiming to trace the energy behind the solar wind, understand the heating of the solar corona, and determine what accelerates the solar wind. The spacecraft will be equipped with advanced instruments to study the sun's corona and solar wind, and will make a Venus flyby before reaching its first perihelion, or closest point to the sun, seven times closer than any other spacecraft has been to the sun. The mission will also pass through the origin of the solar particles with the highest energy. The renaming of the mission is a fitting tribute to Parker, who is considered a pioneer in the field of solar physics.", "answers": ["NASA is going to the sun. More specifically, it's launching an unmanned probe next year that will travel closer to the star than any spacecraft has done previously. \"It's a spacecraft loaded with technological breakthroughs that will solve many of the largest mysteries about our star,\" says Nicola Fox of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. In less scientific terms, per the Telegraph: \"We will finally touch the sun.\" The nuts and bolts: The mission: The 10-foot probe will launch in July or August of 2018 and eventually get to within 3.7 million miles of the sun, about seven times closer than any previous spacecraft. Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025. Corona: The probe will actually fly into the outermost part of the sun's atmosphere, called the corona, per a mission overview at NASA that touts \"humanity's first visit to a star.\" The heat: The probe will rely on a 4.5-inch-thick carbon-composite solar shield to help it withstand temperatures up to 2,550 degrees Fahrenheit, reports Orlando's WKMG. Instruments will remain at room temperature. The name: The probe's name has been changed to the Parker Solar Probe to honor astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who's credited with discovering solar wind. Parker, who turns 90 in June, is a professor emeritus at the University of Chicago, and the Guardian recounts that the theory he put forward in 1958 about a stream of charged particles flowing from the sun was once thought to be \"crazy.\" A first: This is the first time NASA has named a mission after a living scientist. \"I'm certainly greatly honored,\" said the man himself, per Space.com.

{"pred": " A recent study has found that the incidence of colorectal cancer among people under the age of 50 is increasing, with nearly one in seven patients diagnosed with the disease before the recommended age for screening. The study analyzed cancer registry data from 1998 to 2011 and found that 37,847 of the 258,000 patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer were younger than 50. This represents a 15% increase in the number of younger patients diagnosed with the disease. The study also found that younger patients were more likely to have advanced cancer and were more likely to undergo surgery than older patients. Despite having more advanced cancer, younger patients lived slightly longer without a cancer recurrence. These findings suggest that the current guidelines for colorectal cancer screening may need to be reevaluated. Additionally, the study highlights the importance of doctors being aware of the signs of colorectal cancer in younger patients, as they are often diagnosed only after symptoms have developed.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says. More screenings for young people might help, but the yield would be low because under-50s are still less likely to get colon cancer. \"This would be a big and costly change,\" says Hendren, who recommends \"a lot of research\" be done first.

{"pred": " Archaeologists have made groundbreaking discoveries in Australia, challenging long-held assumptions about the country's history. Excavations at the Warrayti rock shelter in the Flinders Ranges have revealed evidence of human settlement dating back 49,000 years, including bone fragments, charcoal, and stone tools. This discovery undermines the previous belief that climate change caused the extinction of megafauna in Australia, as it suggests that humans lived alongside these animals and hunted them. The findings also suggest that Indigenous Australians were innovative and developed local technologies, challenging the Eurocentric view that their material culture was simplistic and backward. The discovery of ancient artefacts, including burnt eggshells, sharpened stone and bone tools, red ochre and gypsum pigments, and the earliest known use of ochre in Australia's history, has been dated to as far back as 49,000 years ago. The tools have been found in a newly discovered cave in the Flinders Ranges, about 550 km north of Adelaide, and include burnt eggshells, sharpened stone and bone tools, red ochre and gypsum pigments, and the earliest known use of ochre in Australia's history. The discovery of these artefacts challenges the previous belief that people may have come from the East, from the Levant, out of Africa, and that modern humans may have come with a package of innovative technologies. Instead, the findings suggest that the development of these fine stone tools, the bone technology, and the use of ochre happened as a local cultural evolution. The discovery of the Warrayti rock shelter and its contents is significant as it provides evidence of human presence in the arid interior of Australia some 10,000 years earlier than previously thought, and challenges the assumption that Indigenous Australians were not as innovative as similar populations elsewhere in the world.", "answers": ["\"A man getting out of the car to go to the toilet led to the discovery of one of the most important sites in Australian pre-history,\" archaeologist Giles Hamm tells ABC News.

At the time, Hamm thought the newly discovered human settlement, a site called Warratyi, was only 5,000 years old. It turns out it's closer to 49,000 years old, and that has huge ramifications for our knowledge of ancient Australian civilization, Sky News reports. Hamm and his team published a study on Warratyi this week in Nature. The discovery of Warratyi in the arid interior of the continent means humans either arrived in Australia up to 10,000 years earlier than previously believed—or they expanded across the continent at a much quicker rate, Science Alert reports. Researchers at the site found 4,300 objects, including tools, and 200 bone fragments from multiple animals, including a 5,500-pound marsupial. The bones help explain how early Australians interacted with megafauna, including hunting them.

The Israeli military has mobilized up to 75,000 reservists and has been carrying out airstrikes and ground operations in Gaza. Hamas has been accused of firing rockets at Israeli cities, including Tel Aviv, for the first time in years.

A Hamas-run TV station reported that Israel had kept firing as well, but Israel says it took a break for at least two hours. In Palestine the death toll has risen to 21, including 13 civilians, Reuters reports. Among those civilians were seven children and a pregnant teenager. Israel's death toll held steady at 3, despite the hundreds of rockets fired into Israel. But Hamas did up the ante by firing rockets near Tel Aviv for the first time. Air-raid sirens sounded (the last time they did so was during the Gulf War) and civilians ran for cover, though the missiles exploded harmlessly, with one going into the sea. \"There will be a price for that escalation,\" Ehud Barak vowed, according to the New York Times.

The study used atmospheric maps to determine that water in the polar reservoirs is enriched in deuterium, indicating that the planet had a global equivalent water layer at least 137 meters deep. This finding supports the idea that Mars was once habitable and may have even supported life. Additionally, the study found that the amount of water on Mars has decreased over time, with the majority of it being lost to space. The search for life on Mars will continue in 2018 with the European Space Agency's Exomars rover, which will look for chemical signatures of life in the Martian soil.

Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

{"pred": " According to a new report by the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, obesity is a growing problem worldwide, with nearly 30% of the global population either obese or overweight. The report, published in the Lancet medical journal, found that obesity rates have risen significantly in both developed and developing countries over the past 30 years, with the highest rates found in the Middle East and North Africa, Central America, and the Pacific and Caribbean islands. The report also found that obesity is now a major risk factor for heart disease, stroke, diabetes, arthritis, and certain cancers, and that chronic complications of weight kill about 3.4 million adults annually. The researchers noted that obesity is a complex problem fueled by the availability of cheap, fatty, sugary, salty, high-calorie \"junk food\" and the rise of sedentary lifestyles, and that not one country has succeeded in cutting its obesity rate. The report highlighted that the richest country, the United States, has the biggest chunk of the planet's obese population, with 13% of its population being obese. The researchers also found that obesity is appearing at increasing young ages, rising nearly 50% in children and adolescents worldwide, and that more than half of the world's obese live in just 10 countries, including the United States, China, India, Russia, Brazil, Mexico, Egypt, Germany, Pakistan, and Indonesia.", "answers": ["There are more obese or overweight people in the world today than there were people of any weight in 1935, the most comprehensive look at worldwide obesity in decades warns.

Not a single country has recorded a decline in obesity over the last 30 years. \"We hoped there would be some examples of success that you could latch onto,\" a study co-author says. \"But there's a complete lack of success stories in bringing down obesity.\" The study published in British medical journal the Lancet found that the Middle East and north Africa had seen the biggest weight gains, though the US still has the largest number of obese people, with 87 million of the world's 671 million obese people, reports Reuters. Other countries, however, have even higher obesity rates, including Tonga, where more than 50% of all adults are obese. \"Two-thirds of the obese population actually resides in developing countries,\" says one of the researchers; they warn that obesity rates are rising among rich and poor countries, men and women, and adults and children alike."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1409}

{"pred": " In the latest news from Egypt, the trial of former President Hosni Mubarak has resumed, with the chief prosecutor accusing him of imposing a \"tyrannical rule\" and dedicating the last 10 years of his presidency to ensuring his son's succession. Mubarak is facing charges of complicity in the killing of over 800 protesters during the popular uprising that forced him out of office. His two sons, Gamal and Alaa, are also facing corruption charges in the same case. The trial has been delayed due to procedural matters, including a demand by lawyers representing the victims that the presiding judge be removed. The prosecution will present its case over the next three days, and Mubarak could face the death penalty if convicted. The military rulers have yet to spell out the formula for allocating seats among parties according to their share of the vote in the parliamentary elections, with some estimates suggesting that the Muslim Brotherhood could come away with a clean majority of the seats. The final stage of voting took place in nine provinces, including the North and South Sinai governorates. The election and Mubarak’s trial are taking place amid growing opposition to the ruling generals, who say they won’t cede power before presidential elections are held by the end of June. Clashes in Cairo last month between security forces and demonstrators left at least 17 people dead, and protesters are preparing to take to the streets on January 25 to mark the anniversary of the mass rallies that drove Mubarak from power. The economy has also been affected, with foreign-currency reserves declining by 44% and the benchmark EGX 30 stock index losing 49% of its value in 2011.", "answers": ["The final round of voting began in Egypt today, and it looks like the Muslim Brotherhood could walk off with a controlling majority of seats in Parliament's lower house. The Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, the country's mainstream Islamist party, had already won a high percentage of the seats awarded in the first and second rounds of voting. Two of the nine provinces voting today are Brotherhood strongholds, where some of the party's most well-known candidates are running, the New York Times reports. A plurality, not a majority, was originally predicted for the Freedom and Justice Party. A majority would allow the party to govern alone, but the Brotherhood has repeatedly said it plans to form a coalition government, and has aligned itself with more liberal parties rather than the ultraconservative Salafis, who are in second place with up to 25% of the seats so far. Also today, prosecutors began presenting their case against former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Bloomberg notes.
