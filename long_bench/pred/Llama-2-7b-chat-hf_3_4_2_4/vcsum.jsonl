The speaker showed a picture of a black hole and explained that it is difficult to observe black holes directly because they do not emit any light in the visible spectrum. However, by using special instruments such as X-ray telescopes, we can observe the hot gas swirling around black holes and learn about their properties. The speaker also explained that black holes have a property called \"redshift,\" which means that the light emitted by the gas around the black hole is shifted towards the red end of the spectrum as it escapes the black hole's gravitational pull. This allows us to infer the presence of a black hole even if we cannot see it directly.\n\nThe speaker then discussed the different wavelengths of light that can be used to observe black holes, including X-rays, ultraviolet light, and visible light. The speaker showed an image of a black hole at different wavelengths, demonstrating how the image appears different depending on the wavelength of light used.

He emphasized the importance of understanding the underlying factors that drive the market and the need to have a long-term perspective when investing.\n\nMr. Pan highlighted three key points:\n\n1. The recent market volatility is primarily driven by the expectation of a decrease in the US Federal Reserve's interest rate, which has led to a decrease in the value of A-shares. However, he believes that the US economy is gradually recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic, and the interest rate is likely to remain low in the short term.\n2.

However, Mr. Pan cautioned against over-investing in the market, as there are still risks associated with it.\n3.

Continue to hold good stocks, even if they have fallen in value, as they have the potential to increase in value in the long term.\n2. Diversify one's portfolio by investing in different industries and sectors, as this can help to reduce risk.\n3.
