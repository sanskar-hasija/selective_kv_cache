The study exposed MRSA to cigarette smoke extract and found that it became harder to kill, with a significant increase in resistance to reactive oxygen species, which are used by macrophages to kill pathogens. The second study, published in the journal Infection and Immunity, found that cigarette smoke exposure can also alter the cell walls of MRSA, making it more resistant to antimicrobial peptides, which are used to pierce bacterial cell walls.

The CDC has reported that 88 cases of AFM have been confirmed in 32 states, with the majority of cases occurring in children. The disease is caused by a virus, but the exact cause is still unknown. Doctors are concerned about the rise in cases and are urging parents to be aware of the symptoms of AFM, which include sudden weakness or paralysis of the arms or legs. The CDC is working to identify the cause of the disease and to develop a treatment. In related news, a study has found that enterovirus D68, which is a common cause of respiratory illness, may be linked to AFM.

The investigation, published in the Journal of Forensic Sciences, used real and synthetic blood samples to test the orientation of stains on the cloth and found that the bloodstains are inconsistent with any one pose, suggesting that a standing model was used to imprint the patterns. The researchers concluded that the linen appears patched with bloodstains from a standing model, not a crucified man or facedown corpse. This finding adds to evidence that the shroud is a medieval fraud. The investigation also found that the angle at which gravity would pull blood dripping from a body in the way seen on the shroud varied with the body part, with some bloodstains tracing angles at odds with each other. The researchers used seven different bloodstain tests on different body parts depicted on the fabric, including the hand, forearm, chest, and lower back, and found inconsistencies in the bloodstains that suggest the shroud is not a genuine religious relic.

The new lawsuit alleges that Singer and the other defendants sexually assaulted the 15-year-old boy at a London hotel suite in 2004. The boy was allegedly given a Quaalude and alcohol before being sexually assaulted by Singer and the other defendants. The lawsuit also claims that the boy was threatened and forced to sit on top of Singer and masturbate. The defendants have denied the allegations and trashed the lawsuit, calling it a \"shakedown.\" Herman has also filed a separate lawsuit against Gary Goddard, a producer of theme park rides, for allegedly sexually assaulting a teenager. The lawsuit claims that Goddard sent the teenager candy and an email with a disturbing message after the alleged sexual assault. Herman has been contacted by other possible molestation victims connected to Hollywood, and he plans to file more lawsuits in the future.

This dinosaur lived around 161 million years ago during the Jurassic Period and had several unique features, including iridescent feathers on its head, neck, and chest. The feathers were similar to those of modern hummingbirds and may have been used for display or mating purposes.

Reuters reports that a closer look at the \"exquisitely preserved,\" almost completely intact fossil of a crow-like dinosaur that lived about 161 million years ago revealed that Caihong juji had luminous, brilliantly hued feathers that closely resembled those of hummingbirds. The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree. And \"glide\" is the operative word, as this dinosaur likely didn't fly: Its feathers were located on its tail, not on its wings like birds, Discover notes.

Here's what to expect from a day of drama in DC: The House has passed legislation to delay ObamaCare for a year and repeal a tax on medical devices, so the measure will return to the Senate this afternoon, just hours before the shutdown is due to kick in. Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business.

The mission is scheduled to launch in summer 2018 and will make a Venus flyby before reaching its first perihelion, or closest point to the sun. The probe will repeat this flyby routine 23 times over its lifetime, and on its final orbits, it will fly within 9 solar radii of the sun's surface, seven times closer than any other spacecraft has been to the sun.

Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025.

The study, conducted by researchers at New York University School of Medicine, followed 9,509 men and women with stable coronary artery disease over five years and found that those with the greatest changes in body weight experienced a 124% higher risk of death, 117% more heart attacks, and 136% more strokes compared to those with the smallest body weight changes. The study suggests that keeping weight off is important for people with coronary artery disease, and that weight fluctuations may be particularly harmful. Additionally, the researchers found a link between changes in body weight and increased risk of new-onset diabetes.

And now researchers are finding that among those with coronary heart disease (CHD)—which the Mayo Clinic reports develops from damaged or diseased blood vessels typically caused by blockage and inflammation—yo-yo dieting may dramatically increase the risk of stroke, heart attack, and death. Reporting in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers say they followed nearly 10,000 men and women with CHD between the ages of 35 and 75 for about five years, monitoring changes in body weight and other health outcomes. The takeaway? \"It's important to lose weight, but this data says you have to keep it off,\" lead researcher Dr. Sripal Bangalore at the New York University School of Medicine tells the New York Times. The highest weight fluctuation was on average 8.6 pounds over five years, while the smallest body weight changes averaged closer to two pounds, reports Medical News Today. Those who were already overweight or obese at the beginning of the study and who experienced the highest level of weight fluctuation experienced 124% more deaths, 136% more strokes, and 117% more heart attacks, meaning these CHD patients were more than twice as likely to suffer these negative outcomes in just a few years than people with CHD whose weight only fluctuated two pounds.

Weapons experts say it's almost impossible to verify if the warhead and missile could be successfully paired unless North Korea were to actually fire a nuclear-tipped ICBM. In response to the nuclear test, South Korea conducted live-fire drills off its east coast to check its \"immediate operational readiness.\" The United States is expected to circulate a resolution at the United Nations to impose the strongest sanctions measures possible to stop Pyongyang's nuclear program. Signs of a rift between South Korean President Moon Jae-in and US President Donald Trump have become apparent despite their decades-long alliance, with Trump criticizing South Korea for \"appeasement\" when it comes to dealing with its northern neighbor. Moon and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe are traveling to Vladivostok for an economic summit, where they will be joined by Russian President Vladimir Putin, who reiterated calls for North Korea to stop nuclear tests but said dialogue needs to be the answer.

But Reuters does pick up some alleged details on those fronts, via an unnamed source quoted by South Korea’s Asia Business Daily. Its source says the ICBM started moving Monday, is only being moved at night, and is headed toward the nation's west coast.

Two more details that allegedly came from the South's National Intelligence Service briefing: word that additional tunnels have been dug out at the North's nuclear test site that would facilitate future detonations, and suspicions that the next ICBM test firing might be directed toward the North Pacific but aimed at a lower angle, which would in theory allow it to fly further than previous tests, which had more of an upward trajectory. Meanwhile, the White House tells Reuters it has given \"in-principle approval\" to a request by South Korean President Moon Jae-in to abolish a limit regarding warhead weights, a move that would strengthen the power with which it could attack the North, if necessary.

This trend is expected to continue, with nearly one in four rectal tumors and over one in 10 colon cancers occurring in people under 50 by 2030. Younger patients are more likely to have advanced stage cancer, but they live slightly longer without a cancer recurrence due to more aggressive treatment. The reasons for this increase are unknown, but risk factors such as smoking, obesity, physical inactivity, and a poor diet may play a role. The study suggests that screening guidelines may need to be reevaluated to account for this trend.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says.

The second discovery, at a cave in the Kimberley region, has provided evidence of human presence in the country's dry interior 10,000 years earlier than previously thought. The finds include burnt eggshells, sharpened stone tools, and red ochre pigment, which suggest that early technologies were developed locally, rather than being brought from elsewhere.

Dan Hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the University of Chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arXiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, LiveScience reports. \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" writes Hooper. \"As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group [of galaxies including the Milky Way] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them.\" Therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \"Dyson spheres\"—an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes LiveScience—to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home. Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies. So how to spot energy-grabbing aliens?

But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts. Others were made of obsidian from as far as 30 miles away, per the Conversation. (These stone tools are also making waves.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 3668}

During his speech, he made several controversial statements regarding gun control and mental illness. Trump mentioned that he has a handgun carry permit in New York and stated that he would emulate Charles Bronson in the vigilante film \"Death Wish\" if attacked. He also criticized \"gun-free zones\" and argued that it doesn't make sense to limit access to firearms, claiming that it's the people, not the guns, that are the problem. Trump also brought up the recent mass shooting at Umpqua Community College in Oregon and stated that he has a license to carry a gun in New York. He added that if someone attacks him, he will respond, and mentioned that he has a concealed carry permit.\n\nIn an interview with NBC's Chuck Todd, Trump accepted the inevitability of mass shootings in the US and blamed mental illness for such incidents. He also defended his tax plan, claiming that he could build a better road for a fraction of the cost. Trump pushed back against those who have said he would save a significant amount of money under his tax plan and claimed that the major tax cut in his plan would hurt him financially.\n\nIn another interview with George Stephanopoulos on ABC's This Week, Trump amplified his argument on gun control, saying that the gun laws have nothing to do with mass shootings and that it's mental illness that's the problem. He also reminisced about the 1974 film \"Death Wish\" and got people in the crowd to shout out the title in unison.\n\nOverall, Trump's statements on gun control and mental illness have been met with criticism and concern, with many arguing that his views are not only insensitive but also dangerous.

{"pred": " A recent study by NASA scientists has revealed that Mars once had a massive ocean that covered nearly half of the planet's surface, with evidence suggesting that the ocean was up to 137 meters deep. The study used atmospheric maps to determine that water in the polar reservoirs is enriched in deuterium, indicating that Mars had a global equivalent water layer at least 8 times deeper than Earth's ocean. This finding supports the idea that Mars was once habitable and may have had life. Additionally, the study found that the Martian atmosphere has been thinning over time, leading to the loss of water to space. The search for life on Mars will continue in 2018 with the European Space Agency's Exomars rover, which will look for chemical signatures of life in the Martian soil. The study also highlights the possibility that life could have originated on Mars and been ejected to Earth as a meteorite. Another recent study analyzed the water vapor in the Martian atmosphere and found that the planet's thin atmosphere can be seen in a photo taken by the Viking 1 orbiter. The team of scientists led by Geronimo Villanueva, of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, took measurements of sunlight reflecting off the Martian surface and through the atmosphere, which revealed the chemical composition of the atmosphere's vapor. The study found that Mars had a higher proportion of deuterium in its water than Earth, indicating that Mars had a much greater amount of water in the past. The study also suggests that the early Martian atmosphere was unusually rich in heavy hydrogen and that much of it escaped along with the ordinary variety, which could have skewed any calculations based on today's values. Overall, the findings continue to mount that Mars was once far wetter and potentially habitable, with the possibility of life existing on the planet in the past.", "answers": ["Imagine all the water in the Arctic Ocean. Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

The model was able to accurately reconstruct the videos, including colors, shapes, and movements, with a high degree of accuracy.\n\nThe implications of this technology are vast, with potential applications in fields such as neuroscience, psychology, and even criminal justice. For example, the technology could be used to broadcast imagery into the minds of people who are paralyzed, allowing them to control their environment by imagining sequences of movements. It could also be used to read memories and dreams, potentially providing new insights into the workings of the human mind.\n\nHowever, the study also highlights the complexities of the human brain and the limitations of the technology. The brain is a highly complex and dynamic system, with many different areas responsible for different aspects of visual processing. As such, the technology may not be able to fully reconstruct the richness and complexity of real-world visual experiences.\n\nOverall, the study represents a significant breakthrough in the field of neuroscience and has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the human mind.", "answers": ["Scientists at UC Berkeley have made a major advancement in the field of mind reading, reconstructing YouTube videos based on brain scans from people who’d seen them. Researchers would put subjects into an MRI machine and track their brain activity as they viewed videos. Once they’d build a model of how a subject’s mind processed the video, “we could read brain activity for that subject and run it backward … to try to uncover what the viewer saw,” one study coauthor tells ABC News. Using the scans they were then able to reproduce the videos—though they’re blurry. “This is a major leap,” the co-author says. He thinks the technique could eventually be used to reconstruct dreams or memories, if it turns out the brain processes those things similarly to how it processes movies. “It’s our next line of research.” (More details on how the experiment worked, along with a video, at PC Magazine.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 1188}

This event occurs when the Moon is at its closest point to Earth, appears blue due to the Earth's atmosphere, and is in the middle of a lunar eclipse. The eclipse will be visible from eastern Asia, the Pacific, and western North America, and will last for 77 minutes. This event is rare because it only happens every 150 years or so, and the last time it occurred was in 1866.\n\nThe Moon will turn blood-red during the lunar eclipse, which will take place during the middle of the night. The Pacific Ocean will be turned towards the Moon at the time, and central and eastern Asia, Indonesia, New Zealand, and most of Australia will get a fine view of this sky show in the evening sky. Heading farther west into western Asia, the Indian subcontinent, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe, the eclipse will already be underway as the Moon rises. Alaska, Hawaii, and northwestern Canada will see the entire eclipse from start to finish.\n\nThe Super Blue Blood Moon will be the first total lunar eclipse of a Blue Moon since 1866, and the next one won't occur until 2037. This event is a great opportunity for astronomy enthusiasts to observe a rare and unique celestial occurrence.\n\nIn addition to the lunar eclipse, there will be three visible supermoons in a row this winter, with the first one appearing on December 3, 2017, and the last one on January 31, 2018. Visible supermoons appear 14% bigger and 30% brighter than full moons that occur at the farthest point in the Moon's orbit.\n\nTo enjoy the Super Blue Blood Moon and lunar eclipse, the best time to go outside is right after moonrise and before sunrise, when the Moon is sitting on the horizon and appears biggest and brightest.

Got all that? When the moon is at or near the closest point to Earth in its orbit (aka, a supermoon), it appears 14% bigger and 30% brighter than full moons that occur at the farthest point in the moon's orbit, though the moon will lose brightness as it enters Earth's shadow, according to NASA. Because of the way Earth's atmosphere bends light, the eclipsed moon will take on a reddish hue, something often referred to as a blood moon, making this rare celestial event \"a super blue blood moon eclipse,\" according to the Miami Herald. The next blue moon eclipse won't occur until 2028. The eclipse will last for 3.5 hours, with the total eclipse stretching for 77 minutes, reports Sky & Telescope.
