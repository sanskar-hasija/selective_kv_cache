{"pred": " Two recent studies have shed light on the harmful effects of cigarette smoke on the human body, particularly in regards to the superbug MRSA. The first study, conducted by researchers at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine, found that cigarette smoke exposure stresses MRSA, causing it to alter its cell walls and become more resistant to toxic substances. This enhances survival against reactive oxygen species, which macrophages generate to kill pathogens. The study found that MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke extract were four times more resistant to macrophage killing than non-exposed MRSA. The second study, led by Dr. Laura Crotty Alexander, found that cigarette smoke exposure makes MRSA more aggressive and better at invading human cells. The study also found that the increased resistance continued for 24 hours after exposure, suggesting it could be inherited. The studies suggest that cigarette smoke functions much like an alarm to the superbug MRSA, warning it to activate its defenses.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 32 new cases of AFM have been confirmed across the country this year, with most cases occurring in children. The CDC is investigating the cause of the illness, but it is believed to be linked to enterovirus D68, which was responsible for a larger outbreak of respiratory illness across the US in 2014. Doctors are urging parents to be aware of the symptoms of AFM, which include sudden weakness or paralysis of the arms or legs, and to seek medical attention immediately if they suspect their child may have the illness. The CDC is working to determine the cause of the recent increase in AFM cases and to develop effective treatments.\n\nIt is important to note that while the CDC has not confirmed any cases of AFM linked to the enterovirus D68, the virus has been detected in some cases. Vaccination against polio and other vaccine-preventable diseases is crucial to prevent severe illness, and parents are encouraged to contact their healthcare provider if their child exhibits sudden weakness or paralysis.

The researchers conducted seven different bloodstain tests on different body parts depicted on the fabric, including the hand, forearm, chest, and lower back, and found that the angle at which gravity would pull blood dripping from a body varied with the body part. The findings add to evidence that the shroud is a medieval fraud and contradict the Vatican's claim that it is an icon rather than a genuine religious relic.

{"pred": " In a recent discovery, scientists have found a new species of theropod dinosaur, Caihong juji, which lived in northeastern China around 161 million years ago. This dinosaur had iridescent feathers on its head, neck, and chest, similar to those of modern hummingbirds. The feathers were likely used for display and social interaction, as seen in modern birds. The discovery of Caihong provides new insights into the evolution of feathers and their role in dinosaur behavior. Additionally, the fossilized remains of Caihong have revealed the presence of melanosomes, which are structures that contain pigments and are responsible for the color of feathers. The discovery of Caihong and its iridescent feathers suggests that the evolution of feathers may have occurred earlier than previously thought, and that they may have played a more significant role in dinosaur behavior than previously believed.", "answers": ["Scientists are now saying there may have been \"a more colorful Jurassic World than we previously imagined,\" thanks to the recent discovery of a fossil in China's Hebei province. Reuters reports that a closer look at the \"exquisitely preserved,\" almost completely intact fossil of a crow-like dinosaur that lived about 161 million years ago revealed that Caihong juji had luminous, brilliantly hued feathers that closely resembled those of hummingbirds. The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree. And \"glide\" is the operative word, as this dinosaur likely didn't fly: Its feathers were located on its tail, not on its wings like birds, Discover notes.

The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line.

{"pred": " A new study has raised concerns about the safety of acetaminophen, a common painkiller and fever reducer, during pregnancy. The study found that women who took acetaminophen during pregnancy may have a higher risk of having children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and similar disorders. The researchers analyzed data from over 64,000 children in Denmark and found that prenatal exposure to acetaminophen may increase the risk of a child being diagnosed with ADHD or being prescribed ADHD medications and exhibiting ADHD-like behaviors. While the study did not show a cause-and-effect relationship, the findings suggest that taking acetaminophen for longer periods and later in pregnancy may be associated with higher risks. The study's authors recommend that pregnant women try to avoid taking painkillers as much as possible until more research is done on the topic. An accompanying editorial emphasizes that the study has found an interesting observed association but does not prove that acetaminophen causes ADHD. The data suggests that taking acetaminophen for longer periods and later in pregnancy is associated with higher risks, with more than half of mothers in the study reporting some acetaminophen use while pregnant. The study's authors suggest that acetaminophen may increase the risk of ADHD by interfering with maternal hormones that are critical for fetal brain development, citing a previous study done using acetaminophen in rats and a study of acetaminophen and autism done with humans. However, other experts caution that the study does not tell us how acetaminophen use during pregnancy causes ADHD and that there are many variables that still need to be considered, such as the fact that ADHD runs in families.

The House of Representatives is working through the weekend to resolve a standoff with the Senate over the health law, with the deadline to approve new funding for federal agencies on Monday night. The Senate has not scheduled any sessions before the deadline, and Democrats are pushing for a hardline approach, while Republicans are considering a short-term funding bill. The shutdown could have significant impacts on the economy, including delays in federal benefits, halting of new applications, and potential furloughs of federal workers. The Washington area could be particularly affected, with possible cuts in federal services, including child-care centers, and potential delays in the delivery of mail. Local governments are setting aside funds to mitigate the effects of a shutdown.", "answers": ["Washington is braced for the first government shutdown in 17 years, which will happen at midnight tonight unless lawmakers manage to break the deadlock over funding and hammer out a deal. Here's what to expect from a day of drama in DC: The House has passed legislation to delay ObamaCare for a year and repeal a tax on medical devices, so the measure will return to the Senate this afternoon, just hours before the shutdown is due to kick in. Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

Reporting in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers say they followed nearly 10,000 men and women with CHD between the ages of 35 and 75 for about five years, monitoring changes in body weight and other health outcomes.

This comes after North Korea conducted its sixth nuclear weapon test on Sunday, which was the most powerful ever detonated by the rogue nation. Weapons experts say it's almost impossible to verify if the warhead and missile could be successfully paired unless North Korea were to actually fire a nuclear-tipped ICBM. In response to the nuclear test, South Korea conducted live-fire drills off the east coast of the Korean Peninsula. The United States is expected to circulate a resolution in the United Nations to impose the strongest sanctions measures possible to stop Pyongyang's nuclear program. Signs of a rift between South Korean President Moon Jae-in and American President Donald Trump have become apparent despite their decades-long alliance, with Trump criticizing South Korea for \"appeasement\" when it comes to dealing with its northern neighbor.

But Reuters does pick up some alleged details on those fronts, via an unnamed source quoted by South Korea’s Asia Business Daily. Its source says the ICBM started moving Monday, is only being moved at night, and is headed toward the nation's west coast.

This trend suggests that colorectal cancer is no longer just an elderly person's disease, and that young people need to be aware of the signs and symptoms of the disease. The study analyzed cancer registry data from 1998 to 2011 and found that 37,847 of the 258,000 patients diagnosed with colorectal tumors were under the age of 50. Younger patients were more likely to have advanced cancer and were more likely to undergo surgery, but they lived slightly longer without a cancer recurrence. These findings raise questions about whether screening for colon cancer should begin at an earlier age. Doctors should be on the lookout for warning signs of colon cancer, such as anemia, bowel bleeding, or a blockage in the colon.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters.

Excavations at the Warrayti rock shelter in the Flinders Ranges have uncovered evidence of human activity dating back 49,000 years, including bone fragments, stone tools, and the use of ochre pigment. This discovery suggests that Indigenous Australians were innovative and developed local technologies, challenging the idea that they were less advanced than other civilisations. The findings also include the presence of bones from extinct megafauna, such as Diprotodon, which suggests that early humans were interacting with these animals. The age of the site has been determined through radiocarbon dating, and the tools and bone fragments have been found to be between 45,000 and 49,000 years old.

The model has been revived recently with a new twist, as astrophysicist Dan Hooper suggests that the expanding universe may cause distant stars to become inaccessible, leading advanced civilizations to capture them before they become unobservable.\n\nIn the second passage, the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine is discussed, with a focus on outsider-uploaded WARCs (Web Archives) that are contributed to the Internet Archive but may not be ingested into the Wayback Machine.\n\nIn the third passage, the concept of Dyson spheres is introduced, which are megastructures that could potentially be built around a star to harness its energy. The idea was first proposed by physicist Freeman Dyson in 1960, and has since been featured in science fiction works such as Larry Niven's \"Ringworld\" and the \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\" episode \"Relics.\" The passage also discusses the potential for advanced civilizations to be recognized by their waste heat, which could be detectable as infrared radiation.", "answers": ["Watch out for stars moving across galaxies or losing power—it could be aliens gathering energy before the lights go out. Dan Hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the University of Chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arXiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, LiveScience reports. \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" writes Hooper. \"As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group [of galaxies including the Milky Way] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them.\" Therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \"Dyson spheres\"—an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes LiveScience—to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home. Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies. So how to spot energy-grabbing aliens? Massive stars emanate certain light wavelengths, which will appear in galaxies' light signatures if stars are drained energy—that is, when humans have powerful enough instruments to detect it."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1741}

An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts. Others were made of obsidian from as far as 30 miles away, per the Conversation. (These stone tools are also making waves.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 3668}

Trump mentioned that he has a handgun carry permit in New York and stated that he would emulate Charles Bronson in the vigilante film \"Death Wish\" if attacked. He also criticized \"gun-free zones\" and argued that it doesn't make sense to limit access to firearms, claiming that the Oregon shootings could have been limited if instructors or students had been armed. Trump also blamed mental illness for mass shootings and defended his newly introduced tax plan, which independent economists estimate will cost $12tn over 10 years.\n\nIn related news, three days after a gunman killed nine people at an Oregon community college and then shot himself dead, Trump seemed to accept the inevitability of mass shootings in the US. In a rare sit-down interview, Trump told Chuck Todd of NBC's Meet the Press that \"no matter what you do, you're gonna have problems\" due to sick people who can be geniuses in a certain way and break the system. Trump also amplified this argument in an interview with George Stephanopoulos on ABC's This Week, saying that the gun laws have nothing to do with the mass shootings and that it's mental illness.\n\nFurthermore, Trump reminisced about the 1974 film \"Death Wish\" and got people in the crowd to shout out the title in unison, highlighting his support for the Second Amendment and self-defense. In response to the shooting on October 1, President Barack Obama delivered his 15th statement addressing gun violence, expressing frustration and sadness over the routine nature of such events.\n\nFinally, Trump also pushed back against those who have said he would save a significant amount of money under his tax plan, claiming that the major tax cut in his plan would hurt him financially.

They say the day after a Born Killers scene in which the girl sat on Sizemore's lap, she told her parents that he had touched her inappropriately, possibly putting his finger inside her. \"At one point her eyes got just huge, like she could've vomited.

The case kicked off in December 2013 with lawsuits that also included two chimps held on private property; each case was struck down, sending the NhRP down the appeals path. Not everyone's convinced the upcoming hearing will mean liberation for the chimps. A Pepperdine University law professor tells Science that the judge likely just wants to hear both sides of the story: \"It would be quite surprising if the judge intended to make a momentous substantive finding that chimpanzees are legal persons\" without doing so, he notes. Prosin, meanwhile, says her group isn't stopping with the chimps and will also target the release of other animals.

{"pred": " A recent study by NASA scientists has revealed that Mars once had a massive ocean that covered nearly half of the planet's surface, with evidence suggesting that the ocean was up to 137 meters deep. The study used atmospheric maps to determine that water in the polar reservoirs is enriched in deuterium, indicating that Mars had a global equivalent water layer at least 20 million cubic kilometers in size. This finding supports the idea that Mars was once habitable and potentially habitable for life.\n\nAdditionally, the study found that the Martian atmosphere has been losing water to space over time, resulting in a higher concentration of deuterium in the remaining water. This suggests that Mars must have had a global ocean that covered a significant fraction of the planet's surface in the past.\n\nThe study also suggests that the early Martian atmosphere was rich in heavy hydrogen, which likely escaped along with the ordinary variety, leading to an underestimation of the amount of water that once existed on the planet.\n\nOverall, the findings of this study provide further evidence that Mars was once a warmer and wetter planet, with the potential for life to exist there in the past. The search for life on Mars will continue with the European Space Agency's Exomars rover set to launch in 2018, which will look for chemical signatures of life in the Martian soil.", "answers": ["Imagine all the water in the Arctic Ocean. Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

The court found that Nestle had failed to prove that the distinctive shape of their four-finger bars was recognized across all member states of the European Union, and therefore their trademark on the shape was invalid. This decision means that the EU's trademark office must review the trademark and could potentially restore protection for Kit Kat's shape.

The case has also been mirrored in the British courts, where Nestle objected to a trademark for the purple color used by Cadbury to wrap its Dairy Milk chocolate bars.", "answers": ["\"Four trapezoidal bars aligned on a rectangular base\" may not be instantly recognizable. Put that setup in chocolate form, however, and many people would be able to distinguish it as a KitKat. Even if that's the case, the European Union's highest court just ruled that the shape of the sweet treat isn't unique enough to merit trademark protection, meaning other confectioners can potentially produce KitKat knockoffs, the Guardian reports. Nestle, which makes KitKats, has been fighting Cadbury (and then Mondelez, which ultimately bought Cadbury) in the courts for more than a decade on this issue. The BBC notes that Nestle first applied for trademark protection for the candy's shape in 2002, and it was granted that protection four years later. Cadbury's pushback began in 2007, and Wednesday's decision by the European Court of Justice essentially tells the EU trademark office it now has to \"reconsider\" its original decision. What that means, however, is that if the EU Intellectual Property Office finds, based on more recent evidence, that the KitKat bar's shape is recognizable in enough countries, it can retain the trademark protection, per Reuters.

{"pred": " A new study published in the journal Evolution suggests that Tyrannosaurus rex may have sounded different than previously thought. The study found that closed-mouth vocalizations, which are low, throaty whooshes of air, are more common in birds than previously believed. The researchers analyzed the vocalizations of 208 bird species and found that 52 of them use closed-mouth vocalizations. The study also found that large-bodied birds are more likely to use this type of vocalization. The findings suggest that the ancestors of birds may have also used closed-mouth vocalizations, and that this behavior may have evolved independently in different groups of animals. The study also sheds light on the evolution of vocalization in dinosaurs, as birds are thought to have evolved from a group of theropod dinosaurs. The researchers suggest that it is likely that some dinosaurs made closed-mouth vocalizations in a manner similar to birds today, perhaps during mating displays.

The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals.

The university has agreed to pay the equivalent of the gift to the organization's Tennessee chapter in exchange for relinquishing its naming rights to the building.

For the first time since 1866, a total lunar eclipse will occur with the blue moon, or second full moon of the month, which—like the one visible on New Year's Day—will also be a supermoon. Got all that? When the moon is at or near the closest point to Earth in its orbit (aka, a supermoon), it appears 14% bigger and 30% brighter than full moons that occur at the farthest point in the moon's orbit, though the moon will lose brightness as it enters Earth's shadow, according to NASA. Because of the way Earth's atmosphere bends light, the eclipsed moon will take on a reddish hue, something often referred to as a blood moon, making this rare celestial event \"a super blue blood moon eclipse,\" according to the Miami Herald. The next blue moon eclipse won't occur until 2028. The eclipse will last for 3.5 hours, with the total eclipse stretching for 77 minutes, reports Sky & Telescope. Those along the Pacific Rim from Alaska and northwestern Canada to central and eastern Asia, Indonesia, New Zealand, and Australia will get the best view of totality during the middle of the night. However, partial phases of the eclipse should be visible under a clear sky in central North America, western Asia, India, the Middle East and eastern Europe, per Space.com. North American viewers should look up as the moon sets on the morning of Jan. 31, while those on the opposite side of the world should see a partial eclipse as the moon rises.
