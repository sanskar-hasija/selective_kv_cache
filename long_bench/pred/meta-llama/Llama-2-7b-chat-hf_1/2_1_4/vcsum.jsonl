However, it is possible to observe the effects of a black hole on the light emitted by nearby stars.\n\nSpeaker 3 added that the reason we can observe the black hole indirectly is because the light emitted by the black hole is not just in the visible light spectrum, but also in other wavelengths such as X-rays and gamma rays. These types of light are not absorbed by the interstellar medium and can be detected from Earth.\n\nSpeaker 4 asked a follow-up question, wondering why we can see a picture of a black hole if it is not in the visible light spectrum. The speaker explained that the picture was created by mapping the data from different wavelengths onto a visible spectrum, similar to how a translation is created by mapping one language onto another.\n\nSpeaker 5 added that the picture was taken using a telescope that can detect light in the 1.3 millimeter wavelength range, and that the color of the picture represents the brightness of the object. The speaker also explained that the color bar on the picture represents the distribution of the radiation emitted by the object, with brighter colors indicating higher radiation levels.\n\nIn summary, the meeting discussed the properties of light and its behavior in different wavelengths, and how these properties allow us to observe and study black holes indirectly through their effects on light emitted by nearby stars.", "answers": ["黑洞是看不到的，我们所观测的是黑洞的光谱进行后期处理后所散发的辐射，黑洞的中心密度远大于外圈，越大的黑洞越难进行撕裂，黑洞的存在时长是可以从周围的环境进行判断，人造黑洞是有可行性的但需要很精准的数据，民间爱好者想要参与对黑洞的探索也可以与国家天文台进行合作，黑洞转化为暗物质有着一定的可行性，古今以来我们对天体和黑洞的探索一直没有中断，以后会更加积极地去填补空白部分。"], "all_classes": null, "length": 1248}
