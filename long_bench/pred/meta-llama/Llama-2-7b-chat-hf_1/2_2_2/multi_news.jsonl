However, the court ruled in favor of the cheerleaders, and the settlement is a significant step towards fair compensation for these individuals.\n\nThis settlement is not the first time that NFL cheerleaders have brought a wage suit against their team. Other teams, such as the Bengals, Buccaneers, Raiders, and Bills, have also faced similar lawsuits.

The Bills cheerleaders are currently seeking class-action status in their lawsuit against the team.\n\nThe issue of unequal pay for NFL cheerleaders is not a new one. In 2014, California cheerleaders won the right to be paid like regular employees, and similar lawsuits have been brought in other states. The issue highlights the exploitation of cheerleaders, who are often required to pay for their own uniforms, hair, and makeup, and who are often subject to strict rules and expectations regarding their appearance.\n\nOverall, the settlement between the New York Jets cheerleaders and the team is a positive step towards fair compensation for these individuals.

The CDC has reported that the majority of cases occur in children, and the average age of patients is 7.6 years old. The illness typically begins with sudden weakness in the arms or legs, and patients often experience altered mental status, seizures, and cranial nerve motor dysfunction. The exact cause of AFM is unknown, but the CDC has identified enterovirus D68 as a possible cause. The CDC is working with state and local health departments to investigate the outbreak and provide guidance to healthcare providers. It is important for caregivers to be aware of the symptoms of AFM and to seek medical attention immediately if a child experiences sudden weakness in the arms or legs.\n\nIt is important to note that the CDC has not confirmed any cases of AFM caused by EV-D68, but the virus has been identified in some cases. It is essential to take precautions to prevent the spread of enteroviruses, such as frequent hand washing with soap and water, avoiding close contact with sick persons, and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces.\n\nIt is also important to keep in mind that the CDC is working to identify the cause of AFM, and the investigation is ongoing.

Recently, a new forensic investigation has cast doubt on the shroud's authenticity. A team of researchers, led by forensic scientist Matteo Borrini and chemist Luigi Garlaschelli, conducted a bloodstain pattern analysis of the shroud, using real and synthetic blood samples to test the orientation of stains on the cloth. Their findings suggest that the bloodstains on the shroud are inconsistent with any one pose, leading them to conclude that the linen has been patched with bloodstains from a standing model, rather than a crucified or facedown corpse. This contradicts the long-held belief that the shroud is the burial cloth of Jesus Christ.

Researchers looking at the blood spatter found that the stains appeared to come from someone standing up, rather than someone who was flat on the fabric, Science Alert reports. As the researchers put it, the stains are \"totally unrealistic\" when compared to what they should look like. The shroud, which is held in the Cathedral of St. John the Baptist in Italy, is considered an icon, as opposed to a genuine religious relic, by the Vatican; Fox News notes \"the church has never weighed in on its authenticity.\" \"This is the kind of forensic work done all the time in police investigations,\" the forensic scientist who conducted the analysis tells BuzzFeed News. \"Even a crucified or hanging person should leave a distinct blood pattern on the cloth, which would be fascinating information to have.\" The study found inconsistent staining, with researchers concluding multiple poses were used to create the bloodstains—a standing model was likely used to imprint patterns on the cloth at various angles for various body parts. Another bloodstain pattern expert notes that more research could be done to see whether cleaning a body or preparing it for burial might account for the inconsistent staining, though he notes that the stains do appear to have come from flowing blood, meaning a heart that was beating at the time the stains were made.

If a child's biological family isn't up to the task, then foster families can step in. But Rowling argues that institutions are absolutely the wrong answer. Rowling has started a charity called Lumos (yes, after one of her Harry Potter spells), and writes that it has made genuine progress in reducing new placements in countries such as Bulgaria, Moldova, and the Czech Republic. She wants to raise awareness and donations with campaigns like this one. \"I recently committed to becoming president of Lumos for life,\" writes Rowling. \"It is my dream that, within my lifetime, the very concept of taking a child away from its family and locking it away will seem to belong to a cruel, fictional world.\" Click for her full column."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1530}

The fossilized remains of this small, duck-sized carnivore were found to have iridescent feathers on its head, chest, and parts of its tail, similar to those of modern hummingbirds.

Caihong's iridescent feathers may have been used for display and mating, similar to modern birds, but the exact function is still unknown. The discovery of Caihong also provides evidence that some dinosaurs had the ability to glide, as the fossilized remains of its wings suggest that it could have glided from tree to tree in forests.

Reuters reports that a closer look at the \"exquisitely preserved,\" almost completely intact fossil of a crow-like dinosaur that lived about 161 million years ago revealed that Caihong juji had luminous, brilliantly hued feathers that closely resembled those of hummingbirds. The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree.

While the study did not establish a direct cause-and-effect relationship, the findings have sparked concern among experts and highlight the need for caution when using acetaminophen during pregnancy.\n\nThe study analyzed data from over 64,000 children and found that prenatal exposure to acetaminophen was associated with an increased risk of ADHD or HKD.

Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025.

However, these patients also have a slightly longer survival rate than older patients. The reasons for this increase in colorectal cancer among younger people are unknown, but risk factors such as obesity, physical inactivity, and a poor diet may play a role.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters.

Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts. Others were made of obsidian from as far as 30 miles away, per the Conversation. (These stone tools are also making waves.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 3668}

The raids at two Nashville facilities and one in Memphis recalled a similar raid in Nashville in November 2009, when agents seized a shipment of ebony from Madagascar.

Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep.

{"pred": " On January 2, the Egyptian government held the third round of voting in the country's third phase of parliamentary elections. The election is taking place amid growing opposition to the ruling generals, who say they won't cede power before the end of June. The election and former President Hosni Mubarak's trial, which resumed last week, take place amid economic uncertainty and growing calls for accountability.\n\nIn the third phase of voting, 150 seats are up for grabs, and 14 million voters are eligible to vote. The Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice party is expected to maintain its lead, with some estimates suggesting they could come away with a clean majority of the seats.\n\nIn the trial of former President Mubarak, the prosecution has accused him of imposing \"tyrannical rule\" and using his position to ensure his son, Gamal, would succeed him. The prosecutor has called for the harshest penalty for Mubarak, who is charged with complicity in the killing of over 800 protesters during the anti-Mubarak uprising. The trial has been bogged down in procedural matters, with the defense demanding the judge be removed.\n\nThe prosecutor has also focused attention on Gamal Mubarak, who has been charged with corruption, and the former president's other son, Alaa. The military rulers have said they intend to retain most of the military's power, with the Parliament taking only limited authority.\n\nThe election and Mubarak's trial are taking place amid economic uncertainty, with the Egyptian pound losing value and tourists and investors being deterred by political instability. The unrest has also led to calls for accountability, with the prosecution in Mubarak's trial pushing for the harshest penalty.\n\nIn conclusion, the third phase of the parliamentary elections is taking place amid political instability and economic uncertainty, with the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice party expected to maintain its lead.

The Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, the country's mainstream Islamist party, had already won a high percentage of the seats awarded in the first and second rounds of voting. Two of the nine provinces voting today are Brotherhood strongholds, where some of the party's most well-known candidates are running, the New York Times reports. A plurality, not a majority, was originally predicted for the Freedom and Justice Party. A majority would allow the party to govern alone, but the Brotherhood has repeatedly said it plans to form a coalition government, and has aligned itself with more liberal parties rather than the ultraconservative Salafis, who are in second place with up to 25% of the seats so far. Also today, prosecutors began presenting their case against former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Bloomberg notes. His trial resumed last week after a two-month break; state TV today showed Mubarak being carried to and from the courtroom on a gurney. \"He deserves an end of humiliation and indignity,\" said the chief prosecutor, according to the AP."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2661}

Here is a one-page summary of all the news:\n\nOn Wednesday evening in Mendon, a car driven by Nabila Altahan was traveling west on Route 4 when the GPS device gave sudden directions to turn around, causing the car to leave the lane of traffic. The car ended up suspended from a telephone guy wire. Altahan and her passenger were not injured in the incident, and the car's sudden movement was likely caused by the GPS device's sudden instructions. A witness at the nearby miniature golf course reported seeing the driver jump out of the car as it was suspended from the pole. State police and the Rutland City Fire Department responded to the scene.\n\nIt is important to note that the GPS device's sudden instructions may have caused the car to leave the lane of traffic, but it is not clear why the device gave such sudden instructions. It is possible that the device's programming or software may have malfunctioned, or that there was a problem with the device's signal.
