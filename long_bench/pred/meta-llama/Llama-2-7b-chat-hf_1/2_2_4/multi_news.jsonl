So far, no treatment has been shown to improve outcomes, but some doctors have suggested that Prozac could potentially be beneficial. The CDC is continuing to investigate the cause of AFM and is urging parents to be aware of the symptoms and to contact a healthcare provider if their child experiences sudden weakness in their arms or legs.

The investigation, published in the Journal of Forensic Sciences, used real and synthetic blood samples to test the orientation of stains on the cloth and found that the bloodstains are inconsistent with any one pose, suggesting that a standing model was used to imprint the patterns. The researchers concluded that the linen appears patched with bloodstains from a standing model, not a crucified man or facedown corpse. This finding adds to evidence that the shroud is a medieval fraud. The investigation also found that the bloodstains on the cloth are inconsistent with the angle of gravity, which would have pulled the blood dripping from a body in the way seen on the shroud. The forearm rivulets corresponded to an arm held straight out around 90 degrees to the side, while the hand marks matched an arm held out at about 45 degrees. Some hand bloodstains traced angles at odds with each other as well, off by as much as 10 degrees.

Another bloodstain pattern expert notes that more research could be done to see whether cleaning a body or preparing it for burial might account for the inconsistent staining, though he notes that the stains do appear to have come from flowing blood, meaning a heart that was beating at the time the stains were made.

The fact that the two women accused of carrying out the attack showed no signs of illness after handling the toxin has raised questions about the effectiveness of the antidote and the possible involvement of third parties.\n\nThe investigation into Kim Jong-nam's death has also highlighted the risks associated with the use of chemical weapons.

Malaysia has arrested several North Korean officials and frozen their assets in response to the killing. North Korea has denied any involvement in the assassination and has accused Malaysia of conspiring with its enemies.

{"pred": " In a recent discovery, scientists have found a new species of theropod dinosaur in northeastern China, which they have named Caihong juji. This dinosaur had iridescent feathers on its head, neck, and chest, similar to those of modern hummingbirds. The feathers were found to have a unique morphology, with long, flat structures arranged in sheets, which are similar to the iridescent feathers of hummingbirds. The discovery of Caihong provides new insights into the evolution of feathers and their role in display and communication in dinosaurs. The fossil was found to have well-preserved remnants of pigment sacs called melanosomes, which suggest that the dinosaur had the ability to produce iridescent colors. The discovery of Caihong also sheds light on the evolution of birds, as it is now the oldest known animal to have asymmetrical feathers, which are a key adaptation for flight. The findings of this discovery suggest that the origins of bird flight may be older than previously thought, and that feathers originally evolved for display and communication rather than flight.", "answers": ["Scientists are now saying there may have been \"a more colorful Jurassic World than we previously imagined,\" thanks to the recent discovery of a fossil in China's Hebei province. Reuters reports that a closer look at the \"exquisitely preserved,\" almost completely intact fossil of a crow-like dinosaur that lived about 161 million years ago revealed that Caihong juji had luminous, brilliantly hued feathers that closely resembled those of hummingbirds. The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree. And \"glide\" is the operative word, as this dinosaur likely didn't fly: Its feathers were located on its tail, not on its wings like birds, Discover notes.

However, the tax has been met with opposition from residents and businesses, who are upset about the price increase and are shopping outside of the city to avoid the tax. The tax has also had a negative impact on local businesses, with some reporting a 34% decline in sales of beverages affected by the tax. The city government appears to have been caught off guard by the visceral response from consumers, and the tax may not achieve its intended goal of improving health and raising revenue. In Cook County, Illinois, a similar tax was repealed after a resounding victory for the beverage industry. The tax was seen as unpopular and had a negative impact on sales and revenue. The repeal of the tax is seen as a win for big corporations like Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, which spent millions fighting the tax. In Spokane, there is concern that if a similar tax were to come to the rest of the state, it would be bad for local businesses. Some residents are worried about the tax coming to their area and are calling for transparency and accountability from their elected officials.

That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits.

Here's what to expect from a day of drama in DC: The House has passed legislation to delay ObamaCare for a year and repeal a tax on medical devices, so the measure will return to the Senate this afternoon, just hours before the shutdown is due to kick in. Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

The spacecraft will be launched in summer 2018 and will be the first mission to visit the sun, aiming to trace the flow of energy that heats and accelerates the sun's corona and solar wind. The probe will be equipped with instruments to study the physical processes occurring in the solar wind and will make 24 orbits of the sun, eventually reaching an orbit within 3.7 million miles of the sun's surface. The mission will provide insight into the physics of stars, improve forecasting of major space weather events, and change our understanding of the sun. The probe will be protected from the sun's extreme temperatures by a 4.5-inch-thick carbon-composite solar shield, and will rely on technological breakthroughs to protect it from the blazing sun.

Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025. Corona: The probe will actually fly into the outermost part of the sun's atmosphere, called the corona, per a mission overview at NASA that touts \"humanity's first visit to a star.\" The heat: The probe will rely on a 4.5-inch-thick carbon-composite solar shield to help it withstand temperatures up to 2,550 degrees Fahrenheit, reports Orlando's WKMG. Instruments will remain at room temperature. The name: The probe's name has been changed to the Parker Solar Probe to honor astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who's credited with discovering solar wind.

{"pred": " A new study has found that rapidly losing and regaining weight, also known as \"yo-yo dieting,\" may increase the risk of deadly heart attacks and strokes for people with coronary artery disease. The study, conducted by researchers at New York University School of Medicine, followed 9,509 men and women with stable coronary artery disease over five years and found that those with the greatest changes in body weight experienced a 124% higher risk of death, 117% more heart attacks, and 136% more strokes compared to those with the smallest body weight changes. The study suggests that keeping weight off is important for people with coronary artery disease, as weight fluctuations may lead to increased risk of heart problems. Additionally, the researchers found a link between changes in body weight and increased risk of new-onset diabetes. The study's lead author, Dr. Sripal Bangalore, notes that while the findings are concerning, they do not prove cause-and-effect and further investigation is needed to understand the relationship between weight fluctuation and heart disease.", "answers": ["Losing weight is one thing, keeping it off quite another. And now researchers are finding that among those with coronary heart disease (CHD)—which the Mayo Clinic reports develops from damaged or diseased blood vessels typically caused by blockage and inflammation—yo-yo dieting may dramatically increase the risk of stroke, heart attack, and death. Reporting in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers say they followed nearly 10,000 men and women with CHD between the ages of 35 and 75 for about five years, monitoring changes in body weight and other health outcomes. The takeaway? \"It's important to lose weight, but this data says you have to keep it off,\" lead researcher Dr. Sripal Bangalore at the New York University School of Medicine tells the New York Times. The highest weight fluctuation was on average 8.6 pounds over five years, while the smallest body weight changes averaged closer to two pounds, reports Medical News Today. Those who were already overweight or obese at the beginning of the study and who experienced the highest level of weight fluctuation experienced 124% more deaths, 136% more strokes, and 117% more heart attacks, meaning these CHD patients were more than twice as likely to suffer these negative outcomes in just a few years than people with CHD whose weight only fluctuated two pounds. This doesn't pinpoint a cause, as pre-existing heart problems could be the culprit, but researchers hope to study this correlation further.

This trend is expected to continue, with nearly one in four rectal tumors and over one in 10 colon cancers expected to be diagnosed in people under 50 by 2030. Younger patients are more likely to have advanced stage cancer and are more likely to receive aggressive treatments, such as surgery and radiation therapy, but they live slightly longer without a cancer recurrence. The reasons for this increase in colon cancer among younger adults are unknown, but risk factors such as smoking, obesity, and a poor diet may be contributing.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says.

Researchers at the site found 4,300 objects, including tools, and 200 bone fragments from multiple animals, including a 5,500-pound marsupial. The bones help explain how early Australians interacted with megafauna, including hunting them.

This discovery challenges the previous belief that modern behaviors such as symbolism, innovation, and art emerged 40,000-50,000 years ago during a \"human revolution.\" The findings suggest that early humans in Kenya's Southern Rift Valley made innovative tools, including axes designed to be held in the palm of the hand, and used exotic materials from far away. The discovery also reveals that the evolution of some of these behaviors occurred much earlier than previously thought in the African stone age. Additionally, the team found distinct differences in the forms of stone tools compared to older deposits in the area, suggesting technological innovation had taken place. The findings provide strong indicators that early Homo sapiens and their immediate African ancestors were at least as smart as the scientists investigating them.\n\nThe discovery of obsidian tools at Olorgesailie, a site in Kenya, suggests that hominid populations needed to adapt or go extinct in response to the effects of long-term, global environmental and climatic change. The team found that the earliest Middle Stone Age technology appeared around the time that our own species, Homo sapiens, was evolving across the continent. The findings suggest that one or more hominin groups were doing seemingly \"modern\" things at this critical time period, including expanding social networks, transmitting information, and innovating technologies. However, the relationship between complex behaviors and hominin species from 500,000 years to 160,000 years ago remains unclear.", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa.

Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts.

This procedure, which is the first of its kind, aims to improve Kieran's confidence and quality of life. The surgery involves harvesting cartilage from Kieran's ribs, shaping it into an ear framework, and then grafting it onto his head. The operation took six hours and was performed by a team of surgeons led by Neil Bulstrode, a consultant plastic and reconstructive surgeon at the hospital. Kieran can already hear thanks to previous surgery and a hearing aid, but the new ears will improve his ability to hear and communicate with others. The surgery is cosmetic, but it is expected to have significant psychological benefits for Kieran, who has struggled with bullying and low self-esteem due to his condition. The hospital performs about 40 of these operations each year, and researchers are working on developing new techniques using stem cells from patients' fat tissue to grow new ear frameworks.", "answers": ["An operation in London has given 9-year-old Kieran Sorkin a pair of ears—made from his ribs, no less.

Every year about 100 British newborns lack one or both ears (it's called microtia), and the hospital Kieran went to performs the operation about 40 times a year. Scientists hope to one day make ears from the fat tissue of patients, instead of ribs.

Israel has mobilized 75,000 reservists and launched airstrikes on Hamas targets, while Hamas has fired rockets at Israeli cities. Egypt has called for a ceasefire and has sent a delegation to Gaza, but efforts to broker a truce have so far been unsuccessful. The conflict has resulted in the deaths of at least 29 Palestinians and 3 Israelis, and has raised concerns about a wider regional conflict.", "answers": ["A brief, planned ceasefire failed to materialize in Gaza today, as death continued to rain down on the strip. Israel had offered to hold its offensive to accommodate a visit from Egyptian Prime Minister Hesham Kandil, provided Hamas held its fire as well.

A Hamas-run TV station reported that Israel had kept firing as well, but Israel says it took a break for at least two hours. In Palestine the death toll has risen to 21, including 13 civilians, Reuters reports. Among those civilians were seven children and a pregnant teenager. Israel's death toll held steady at 3, despite the hundreds of rockets fired into Israel. But Hamas did up the ante by firing rockets near Tel Aviv for the first time. Air-raid sirens sounded (the last time they did so was during the Gulf War) and civilians ran for cover, though the missiles exploded harmlessly, with one going into the sea. \"There will be a price for that escalation,\" Ehud Barak vowed, according to the New York Times.

Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

Bayesian statisticians can help refine and focus the hunt for the plane and for a solution to the deepening mystery of its disappearance. The approach involves layering new information, such as flight path, wind, ocean flow, and which areas have been searched already, to update the probability estimate of the plane's location. The Metron team used this approach to help locate the wreckage of Air France Flight 447, which crashed in 2009 en route from Rio de Janeiro to Paris, killing all 228 people on board. The team calculated the probability that the beacon would be heard within 1,730 meters as at least 90 percent, and capped that probability at 90 percent based on learning from past searches that manufacturers' specifications and operator estimates tend to be optimistic. The team also accounted for the possibility that the beacons had been damaged in the crash and assessed the uncertainties of each piece of data using Bayesian principles of probability. The team split up the search area into a grid and applied to each cell a figure representing the probability that the plane would be found there. The article highlights the challenges of finding basic information about which areas have already been searched and the subjectivity inherent in the approach. However, Bayesian hunters can quantify subjective judgment by using expert testimonies and imagination. The article concludes that even finding debris might not mean finding the bulk of the plane, and that the probability of finding the plane is still unknown.", "answers": ["Forget satellite images and aerial searches—the best way to find Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 may be with mathematical techniques dating back to the 18th century, the BBC reports. That's how Air France flight 447 was found in 2009, using \"Bayesian statistics\" to measure the probability of the plane being in one place or another. Named after Presbyterian minister and mathematician Thomas Bayes, the technique allowed experts to apply several factors to each point on a map: For example, what was the chance it crashed from mechanical failure? How far do planes tend to crash from their last known location? What was the chance that search teams missed debris in various locations?

His two sons, Gamal and Alaa, are also facing corruption charges.

The final stage of voting took place on January 2, with the Brotherhood working to stretch its lead. Some estimates indicate that the Brotherhood could come away with a clean majority of the seats in the full Parliament instead of the plurality indicated by previous results.
