The speaker showed a picture of a black hole with different colors representing different wavelengths of light, with the darkest colors representing the longest wavelengths. The speaker explained that the colors in the picture were created by mapping the energy of the black hole onto different wavelengths, using a technique called \"color mapping.\"\n\nThe speaker then discussed the different types of light that can be used to observe black holes, including X-rays, ultraviolet light, and visible light. The speaker explained that X-rays are the most useful for observing black holes because they can penetrate through the dust and gas in the universe and provide the most detailed information about the black hole's properties.\n\nThe speaker also discussed the limitations of observing black holes, including the fact that they are often surrounded by dust and gas that can block our view of them. The speaker explained that to overcome this limitation, astronomers use a technique called \"interferometry,\" which involves combining data from multiple telescopes to create a higher-resolution image of the black hole.\n\nFinally, the speaker answered questions from the audience, including one question about why we can see a black hole even though it is in a different wavelength of light than what we can see with our eyes. The speaker explained that by using a technique called \"color mapping,\" astronomers can convert the energy of the black hole into a visible wavelength, allowing us to see it.
