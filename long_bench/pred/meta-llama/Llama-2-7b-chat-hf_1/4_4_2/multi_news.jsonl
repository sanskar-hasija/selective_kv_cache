Herman has also been contacted by other possible molestation victims connected to Hollywood, and he plans to file more lawsuits in the future.

The fossilized remains of this small, bird-like dinosaur have revealed a unique feature - iridescent feathers on its head, chest, and tail. The feathers are similar to those of modern hummingbirds and may have been used for display or mating purposes. The discovery of Caihong juji provides new insights into the evolution of feathers and the origins of birds. The fossil also shows that feathers evolved for display before being adapted for flight. Additionally, the discovery of Caihong juji has led to the realization that the iconic bird-like dinosaur Archaeopteryx, which lived 10 million years later, also had asymmetrical feathers. The discovery of Caihong juji has shed new light on the evolution of birds and the role of feathers in their evolution.", "answers": ["Scientists are now saying there may have been \"a more colorful Jurassic World than we previously imagined,\" thanks to the recent discovery of a fossil in China's Hebei province. Reuters reports that a closer look at the \"exquisitely preserved,\" almost completely intact fossil of a crow-like dinosaur that lived about 161 million years ago revealed that Caihong juji had luminous, brilliantly hued feathers that closely resembled those of hummingbirds. The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree. And \"glide\" is the operative word, as this dinosaur likely didn't fly: Its feathers were located on its tail, not on its wings like birds, Discover notes.

A woman in California, Myrna Arias, has filed a lawsuit against Intermex Wire Transfer LLC after she was fired for refusing to install an app that tracked her location even when she was off the clock. The app, provided by Xora, contained a GPS function that tracked the location of employees. Arias objected to the monitoring of her location during non-work hours and was fired shortly after her objection.\n2. Intermex required employees to install the app to monitor their locations, even outside of work hours, without providing any notice or consent. The app also tracked employees' driving speeds, roads taken, and time spent at customer locations.\n3. Arias' attorney, Gail Glick, stated that an employer can legally monitor employees at work if there is a legitimate business interest to do so, but if an employee cannot stop it, then it is an invasion of privacy.\n4. Arias is seeking an injunction and general, special, and punitive damages for invasion of privacy, retaliation, labor code violations, intentional interference with contract, wrongful termination, and unfair business practices.\n5. The case highlights the ongoing debate around workplace privacy and employee monitoring, particularly in the context of technology and location tracking. It also raises questions about the balance between employers' rights to monitor employees and employees' right to privacy.", "answers": ["Myrna Arias didn't like the GPS app on her phone that constantly tracked her, so she uninstalled it. The problem: Arias' iPhone was issued by her employer, which required her to run the app constantly, and after she removed it, the California woman was fired. Now she's suing her former employer, money transfer service Intermex, for invasion of privacy, unfair business practices, and retaliation, among other things, Ars Technica reports. Arias started researching the app, then called Xora—its website touts the app's ability to let employers \"instantly see where their employees are and where they have been\"—and eventually she and some of her colleagues asked a trainer from the app company to clarify. Boss John Stubits then, per the suit, \"admitted that employees would be monitored while off duty and bragged that he knew how fast she was driving at specific moments.\" Arias says she has no problem being monitored while at work, but she complained to Stubits about being tracked in her free time; he was unsympathetic and said she should have no problem because of how much she was being paid by Intermex. \"Her manager made it clear that he was using the program to continuously monitor her, during company as well as personal time,\" the complaint states, noting that he told Arias she needed to keep her phone on at all times in case a customer called. Arias' attorney tells Courthouse News that there was no way to turn the app off, as it would constantly run in the background. \"She found it very offensive that they were treating her like a felon,\" the attorney says. Arias says her boss \"scolded\" her for uninstalling the program last year, and fired her soon after.

Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%).

Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit.

The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep.

The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals.

{"pred": " The article discusses the use of Bayesian statistics in searching for missing planes, such as Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. Bayesian statistics is a method of statistical inference that allows for the probability of an event to be estimated based on prior knowledge or experience. In the case of Flight 370, Bayesian statisticians are using historical data and subjective judgment to inform their search efforts. The article highlights the challenges of finding basic information about which areas have already been searched and the subjectivity inherent in the approach. However, the use of Bayesian statistics has helped in finding the wreckage of Air France Flight 447, which crashed in 2009 en route from Rio de Janeiro to Paris, killing all 228 people on board. The team outlined its success in a paper that makes plain the subjectivity inherent to the approach. The Metron team had to account for the possibility that an earlier search covered an area including the wreckage site but missed it. They calculated the probability that this search failed not because it was in the wrong area but because the beacons malfunctioned. The team also had to account for the possibility the beacons had been damaged in the crash. The team split up the search area into a grid, and applied to each cell a figure representing the probability that the plane would be found there. The team lowered the probability of the plane being found in locations that had already been searched. The Bayesian approach allows for the consideration of all the data, including uncertainties, which is very important as nothing is certain. The approach also allows for the combination of views that contradict each other. The team could be sure that the plane had come down within a 40-mile radius of the last location pinged out by its on-board computer system. The probability map provided by Keller and her team gave a much tighter area to search. A team went out there, hoping that finally the mystery would be solved. But those hopes were dashed. There was no sign of the plane. The Metron statisticians now adapted their model to a possible scenario and came up with a new area of highest probability.

That's how Air France flight 447 was found in 2009, using \"Bayesian statistics\" to measure the probability of the plane being in one place or another. Named after Presbyterian minister and mathematician Thomas Bayes, the technique allowed experts to apply several factors to each point on a map: For example, what was the chance it crashed from mechanical failure? How far do planes tend to crash from their last known location? What was the chance that search teams missed debris in various locations?

The military rulers have yet to spell out the formula for allocating seats according to their share of the vote, which has led to concerns about the power of the Parliament.", "answers": ["The final round of voting began in Egypt today, and it looks like the Muslim Brotherhood could walk off with a controlling majority of seats in Parliament's lower house. The Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, the country's mainstream Islamist party, had already won a high percentage of the seats awarded in the first and second rounds of voting. Two of the nine provinces voting today are Brotherhood strongholds, where some of the party's most well-known candidates are running, the New York Times reports. A plurality, not a majority, was originally predicted for the Freedom and Justice Party. A majority would allow the party to govern alone, but the Brotherhood has repeatedly said it plans to form a coalition government, and has aligned itself with more liberal parties rather than the ultraconservative Salafis, who are in second place with up to 25% of the seats so far. Also today, prosecutors began presenting their case against former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Bloomberg notes. His trial resumed last week after a two-month break; state TV today showed Mubarak being carried to and from the courtroom on a gurney. \"He deserves an end of humiliation and indignity,\" said the chief prosecutor, according to the AP."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2661}
