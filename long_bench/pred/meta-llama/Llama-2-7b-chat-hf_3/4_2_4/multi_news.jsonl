The study found that cigarette smoke exposure stresses MRSA, causing it to alter its cell walls to repel toxic substances, leading to increased resistance to macrophages and antimicrobial peptides. Another study published in the same journal found that cigarette smoke exposure can also help MRSA to invade human cells more effectively. These findings suggest that cigarette smoke may play a role in the growing problem of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and that smokers may be more susceptible to infections.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there have been 32 confirmed cases of AFM in the United States this year, which is a significant rise compared to the 7 cases reported in 2014. The CDC is investigating the cause of the illness, but it is believed to be linked to enterovirus D68, which was also associated with a larger outbreak of respiratory illness in 2014. So far, no treatment has been shown to improve outcomes, but some doctors have suggested that Prozac could potentially be beneficial. The CDC is urging healthcare providers to report any cases of AFM to them, and is providing guidance on how to manage the illness. It is important to note that while the CDC has not confirmed any cases of AFM caused by EV-D68, being up to date on all recommended vaccinations is essential to prevent severe diseases, including polio.

The investigation, published in the Journal of Forensic Sciences, used real and synthetic blood samples to test the orientation of stains on the cloth and found that the bloodstains are inconsistent with any one pose, suggesting that a standing model was used to imprint the patterns. The researchers concluded that the linen appears patched with bloodstains from a standing model, not a crucified man or facedown corpse. This finding adds to evidence that the shroud is a medieval fraud. The investigation also found that the angle at which gravity would pull blood dripping from a body on the shroud varied with the body part, with some bloodstains tracing angles at odds with each other.

Another bloodstain pattern expert notes that more research could be done to see whether cleaning a body or preparing it for burial might account for the inconsistent staining, though he notes that the stains do appear to have come from flowing blood, meaning a heart that was beating at the time the stains were made.

Caihong had a bird-like body, including the sorts of feathers required for flight, but it had a crested head that more closely resembles that of a Velociraptor. The team also found that Caihong's tail had asymmetrical feathers, which may have been used for aerodynamic locomotion. This discovery provides new insights into the evolution of feathers and the behavior of early bird-like dinosaurs.", "answers": ["Scientists are now saying there may have been \"a more colorful Jurassic World than we previously imagined,\" thanks to the recent discovery of a fossil in China's Hebei province. Reuters reports that a closer look at the \"exquisitely preserved,\" almost completely intact fossil of a crow-like dinosaur that lived about 161 million years ago revealed that Caihong juji had luminous, brilliantly hued feathers that closely resembled those of hummingbirds. The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree. And \"glide\" is the operative word, as this dinosaur likely didn't fly: Its feathers were located on its tail, not on its wings like birds, Discover notes.

{"pred": " On May 31, 2017, NASA announced that its upcoming solar exploring spacecraft, the Parker Solar Probe, will be renamed in honor of astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who predicted the existence of the solar wind in 1958. The spacecraft will be launched in summer 2018 and will be the first mission to visit the sun, aiming to trace the energy behind the solar wind, understand the heating of the solar corona, and determine what accelerates the solar wind. The spacecraft will be equipped with advanced instruments to study the sun's corona and solar wind, and will make a total of 24 flybys of Venus to gain a gravity assist and shrink its orbit around the sun. The mission will also pass through the origin of the solar particles with the highest energy. The Parker Solar Probe will be the closest spacecraft to the sun, reaching a distance of 9 solar radii, or seven times closer than any other spacecraft has been to the sun before. The mission will improve space weather forecasting and help answer questions about how stars work.", "answers": ["NASA is going to the sun. More specifically, it's launching an unmanned probe next year that will travel closer to the star than any spacecraft has done previously. \"It's a spacecraft loaded with technological breakthroughs that will solve many of the largest mysteries about our star,\" says Nicola Fox of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. In less scientific terms, per the Telegraph: \"We will finally touch the sun.\" The nuts and bolts: The mission: The 10-foot probe will launch in July or August of 2018 and eventually get to within 3.7 million miles of the sun, about seven times closer than any previous spacecraft. Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025. Corona: The probe will actually fly into the outermost part of the sun's atmosphere, called the corona, per a mission overview at NASA that touts \"humanity's first visit to a star.\" The heat: The probe will rely on a 4.5-inch-thick carbon-composite solar shield to help it withstand temperatures up to 2,550 degrees Fahrenheit, reports Orlando's WKMG. Instruments will remain at room temperature. The name: The probe's name has been changed to the Parker Solar Probe to honor astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who's credited with discovering solar wind. Parker, who turns 90 in June, is a professor emeritus at the University of Chicago, and the Guardian recounts that the theory he put forward in 1958 about a stream of charged particles flowing from the sun was once thought to be \"crazy.\" A first: This is the first time NASA has named a mission after a living scientist. \"I'm certainly greatly honored,\" said the man himself, per Space.com. Two puzzles: Scientists hope to better understand two things in particular: \"How is the solar wind accelerated, and why is the ... corona so much hotter than the solar surface?\" (It's 3 million degrees Fahrenheit vs. 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit.) Why it matters: Generally, solar storms are relatively harmless when they reach Earth, but these particle bursts occasionally wreak havoc on satellites and here on Earth, and they have the potential to be devastating. \"The more we know about how these processes work, the better we can get at predicting when they will happen,\" writes Loren Grush at the Verge."], "all_classes": null, "length": 10147}

The issue at Neiman appears to have gone on for significantly longer than the widespread attack on Target. In contrast, Target informed its customers about its attack within a few days of learning about it for the first time.\n\nA 17-page report from a computer firm hired to investigate the Target data breach provides new insight into the holiday hacking.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%).

However, this defense drew criticism from CNN contributor Ana Navarro, who argued that the tweet was an incitement to violence and could lead to someone getting killed.\n2. President Trump asserted that his social media use is \"modern day presidential,\" despite his frequent controversial tweets. This comes after he accused the media of trying to convince lawmakers that he should stop using Twitter.\n3. The President's tweets have repeatedly sparked controversy since he entered the White House, with some Republicans expressing concerns about his Twitter habit. Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse and Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski are among those who have spoken out against the President's tweets, with Sasse calling them \"beneath the dignity\" of the presidential office and Murkowski asking if Trump wants to be remembered for his tweets or his accomplishments.\n4. President Trump's incendiary tweets have been a source of controversy throughout his presidency, with some critics arguing that they are not presidential and could lead to harmful consequences. However, Trump has defended his tweets, saying that they are a way for him to speak directly to the American people and bypass the media.\n5.

The removal of the headphone jack has been met with ridicule and disbelief, with many comparing it to the company's previous moves, such as killing the CD drive and 30-pin connector. The justification for the removal of the headphone jack is due to space constraints inside the iPhone, with Apple wanting to prioritize stereo speakers and Taptic engines.

The event has also seen criticism of Apple's marketing chief, Phil Schiller, for his explanation of the decision, which has been mocked on Twitter.

The article also highlights the psychological benefits of reconstructive surgery for children with microtia, stating that it can greatly improve their confidence and overall well-being.", "answers": ["An operation in London has given 9-year-old Kieran Sorkin a pair of ears—made from his ribs, no less. Born deaf with no ears, Kieran was able to hear because of an implanted hearing aid, but he still wanted ears. \"I want people to stop asking me questions,\" he told the BBC. \"I'd like just to look like my friends. I'd also like to be able to wear sunglasses and earphones.\" So surgeons traced an outline of Kieran's mom's ears, removed cartilage from the boy's ribs, and sliced, contoured, and sewed the cartilage. Then they put it in two skin pockets and vacuumed them into the shape of ears. They don't perform any function, but Kieran's plastic surgeon says they can deliver a huge confidence boost: \"If you can change the confidence of a patient at this young age, you can change their whole trajectory in life,\" he said. The ears should last, too, because they're made of cartilage rather than prosthetics, the Guardian reports. Every year about 100 British newborns lack one or both ears (it's called microtia), and the hospital Kieran went to performs the operation about 40 times a year. Scientists hope to one day make ears from the fat tissue of patients, instead of ribs. Kieran might have liked that, since he got so excited on seeing his new ears that he cried \"Wow!\" and giggled—which made his ribs hurt from the operation.

The operation came after a series of tit-for-tat skirmishes between Israel and Palestinian militants, and followed a rocket attack on Tel Aviv that killed three people. Israel has mobilized 75,000 reservists and launched airstrikes on Hamas targets, while Egypt has called for a truce and is mediating a possible ceasefire. The conflict has resulted in the deaths of 29 Palestinians, including 13 militants and 16 civilians, and three Israelis. The United States has supported Israel's operation while pressing Egypt to rein in Hamas, and Egypt's Prime Minister has visited Gaza to explore a possible truce. The situation remains tense, with both sides refusing to back down.", "answers": ["A brief, planned ceasefire failed to materialize in Gaza today, as death continued to rain down on the strip. Israel had offered to hold its offensive to accommodate a visit from Egyptian Prime Minister Hesham Kandil, provided Hamas held its fire as well. But Hamas said it would keep firing, and one Israeli defense minister complained that 50 rockets had flown in from Gaza during Kandil's visit, CNN reports. A Hamas-run TV station reported that Israel had kept firing as well, but Israel says it took a break for at least two hours. In Palestine the death toll has risen to 21, including 13 civilians, Reuters reports. Among those civilians were seven children and a pregnant teenager. Israel's death toll held steady at 3, despite the hundreds of rockets fired into Israel. But Hamas did up the ante by firing rockets near Tel Aviv for the first time. Air-raid sirens sounded (the last time they did so was during the Gulf War) and civilians ran for cover, though the missiles exploded harmlessly, with one going into the sea. \"There will be a price for that escalation,\" Ehud Barak vowed, according to the New York Times. Israel has now hit 250 Gaza targets, while taking further steps toward a ground invasion, calling up 16,000 reservists, the Wall Street Journal reports. It's also steadily sending troops and armored vehicles to the border, notes CNN—between 1,500 and 2,000 are already there, one official said. Israel claims the attacks have weakened Hamas' military capabilities and caused its attacks to lighten, but Hamas denied that, saying it had hit multiple Israeli targets today. Kandil emerged from his meeting with Hamas expressing solidarity, saying the new Egyptian regime would be more active in helping the Palestinians. \"The time has changed,\" he said. \"No longer the Israeli occupation will be able to carry out their attacks against the Palestinians without being held responsible.

{"pred": " A recent study by NASA scientists has revealed that Mars once had a massive ocean that covered nearly half of the planet's surface, with evidence suggesting that the ocean was present as recently as 4 billion years ago. The study used atmospheric maps to determine that water in the Martian atmosphere is enriched in deuterium, a heavy isotope of hydrogen, which indicates that the planet had a global ocean that was at least 137 meters deep. This finding supports the idea that Mars was once habitable and could have supported life. Additionally, the study found that the Martian atmosphere has been losing water to space over time, which could have led to the formation of a global ocean in the northern hemisphere.\n\nSeparately, a new analysis of water vapor in the Martian atmosphere has revealed that the planet's hydrogen isotopic composition is different from Earth's, with Mars having a higher proportion of deuterium. This suggests that Mars may have had a different origin and evolution than Earth, and could have had a different geological and biological history.\n\nOverall, these findings provide further evidence that Mars was once a warm and wet planet, and suggest that the planet may have been habitable in the distant past.

Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

The Dark Overlord told the AP in February they wouldn't release any of the stolen episodes; it's unclear why that changed. The hacker also claims to have stolen TV series from ABC, National Geographic, Fox, and IFC via the hack at Larson Studios. They're reportedly seeking a \"modest\" ransom for those as well.

The report, published in the Lancet medical journal, found that obesity rates have risen significantly in both rich and poor countries over the past 30 years, with some countries experiencing extraordinary levels of obesity. The report highlights that obesity is not just a problem in developed countries, but also in developing countries, where rates are accelerating. The researchers noted that population-wide weight gains and income gains generally go hand in hand around the world, which supports the theory that a major cause of obesity is that food has become cheap relative to income. The report also found that obesity is a complex problem fueled by the availability of cheap, fatty, sugary, salty, high-calorie \"junk food\" and the rise of sedentary lifestyles. The researchers emphasized that obesity is not just a cosmetic issue, but a main risk factor for morbidity and mortality. The report highlighted that more than half of the world's obese live in just 10 countries, including the United States, China, India, Russia, Brazil, Mexico, Egypt, Germany, Pakistan, and Indonesia. The report concluded that there is no single country that has seen a decline in obesity rates over the past 30 years, highlighting the need for urgent action to address this global public health dilemma.", "answers": ["There are more obese or overweight people in the world today than there were people of any weight in 1935, the most comprehensive look at worldwide obesity in decades warns.

{"pred": " In the latest news from Egypt, the trial of former President Hosni Mubarak has resumed, with the chief prosecutor accusing him of imposing a \"tyrannical rule\" and dedicating the last 10 years of his presidency to ensuring his son's succession. Mubarak is facing charges of complicity in the killing of over 800 protesters during the popular uprising that forced him out of office. His two sons, Gamal and Alaa, are also facing corruption charges in the same case. The trial has been delayed due to procedural matters, including a demand by lawyers representing the victims that the presiding judge be removed. The prosecution will present its case over the next three days, and Mubarak could face the death penalty if convicted.
